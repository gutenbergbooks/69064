<span class="smaller">ALONG THE WHITE ROAD</span></h2>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> July sunshine lay hot and
golden over the fields of wheat on
the Italian hillsides, and the deep
shade of the chestnut woods along the
road was more inviting than the white glare
beyond. The sun stood directly overhead,
and along the middle of that white, dusty
road there was not an inch of shadow.</p>

<p>A small brown house on wheels crept
slowly along this sunny way, drawn by a
queer, ill-matched team of three&mdash;a plump
white horse with long, silky mane and tail,
a large spotted horse with fierce eyes and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>nostrils, and a lean, little brown pony, with
strangely twisted neck.</p>

<p>Up and up, always a little higher up, the
horses toiled with the house-wagon, as the
road rose into the mountains. From the
interior of the wagon came the sound of
voices, mingled now and then with a complaining
note, or an exclamation of pain.
The travelers were very tired, and poor
Pietro’s fever was rising with every turn of
the wheels.</p>

<p>Several men and a sturdy girl of fifteen
walked beside the horses in the powdery white
dust. Behind the big wagon lagged a boy
of eight or nine years. This was Natale,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
a slight little fellow, with dusty lean legs
and dragging feet. His light brown hair
curled damply about his sun-browned forehead,
and he wore an old, misshapen hat
set far back on his pretty head. His loosely
fitting clothes were dingy with dust but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>Natale did not mind, for, presently, they
would come to Cutigliano, the old, old
town on the mountain side, and there they
would camp out on the soft, green grass.
And Natale knew from much experience
that nothing could clean the dust from
travel-stained clothes so well as rolling down
the grassy slopes of the chestnut woods,
with Niero and Bianco as companions.</p>

<p>Of course the sun was hot; was it not
always hot at noon of a summer’s day in
the Apennines? But Niero did not complain,
and why should Natale?</p>

<p>Bianco had tired of trotting along at
Natale’s side, and at the last stopping-place,
when Pietro had had a drink of
water from the wayside fountain, the tired
little black dog had begged to be allowed
to ride, and had been willingly taken inside
the wagon.</p>

<p>Natale never asked to ride in the wagon,
unless he were very tired and sleepy. They
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>were rather crowded in there even without
him, for Pietro took up a great deal of room,
now that he had to lie down all the time.
Besides, the other children, good travelers
as they usually were, sometimes grew
quarrelsome and made the mothers and
the grandmother angry. Natale did not
like quarreling and loud voices, so he always
preferred his resting times to be given
him on the back of one of the horses. But
now Tesoro and Il Duca were tired also, and
they were so near Cutigliano, it did not
matter if Natale did lag behind a little,
always with big Niero for company.</p>

<p>Niero was a large, lean, white dog with a
closely sheared body. About his neck,
however, he wore a fluffy collar of long
white hair, and bracelets of the same
adorned his four paws, while his long tail
ended in a tuft, having very much the appearance
of a dishmop. Why this white
dog should have been named Niero, meaning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
black, the clown who had also named the
little black dog Bianco, white, could have
best explained.</p>

<p>By and by, long after the gray church
tower had come in sight and the red-tiled
roofs of the town showed bunched together
against the green of the wooded hillside, the
travelers reached the arched stone bridge
across the river at the foot of the mountain.
Here the wagon made a halt before beginning
the last steep climb to the town.
Above, they could see the stone wall which
was the boundary of the road winding by
loops, one above the other, up the mountain
side, but the town had now disappeared
from view, so sheer was the rise of the
chestnut woods.</p>

<p>This halt gave Natale time to come up
with the wagon, and then he sat down with
a tired sigh on a heap of mending-stones by
the roadside, in front of the wagon door.
His legs ached with weariness, but this was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>no time to think of riding, as even the
women and all the children but Pietro must
alight now, to relieve the horses in the last
pull up hill. Natale watched them descend
from the wagon one by one, by the steps one
of the musicians placed at the door.</p>

<p>First came Nonna, the grandmother of
Rudolfo and Tito and the five other children
of the blond acrobat, Antonio Bisbini. She
was not Natale’s Nonna, of course, yet
everybody called her Nonna, and why
should not he, who had no grandmother of
his own?</p>

<p>Nonna carried Tito in her arms and led
Rudolfo by the hand. Then came Tito’s
mother, the three-months’-old infant, Gigi,
in her arms, followed by Olga, who held
little Maria by the hand. Next, Natale’s
own mamá stepped down, glad to stretch her
active limbs by walking, after nursing
Pietro for so many tedious hours. Then
the rest of Bisbini’s children scrambled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>out, aided by the music-man’s helping
hands.</p>

<p>On they went again then, the clown, who
was Natale’s stepfather, walking at the
horses’ heads, and cracking his long whip,
and chirruping to them while the other men
strode behind the wagon, pushing upon it
with all their might at the steep places in
the road.</p>

<p>The women and children, meanwhile, left
the road to climb the short cuts upward,
leading directly from terrace to terrace,&mdash;mere
paths paved with rough stones, here
and there loosened and displaced by rushing
rain-torrents of the past. The little ones
bore the heat and the roughness of the way
without murmuring, being allowed to
straggle along as they pleased, now stopping
to gather a red poppy from the edge
of the wheat, now dropping on the ground
to search for a briar afflicting some tired
foot. Natale was not the last in the procession<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
now, for he was anxious to get
to the top and see what the tall wheat
and the green slopes were hiding from
his eyes.</p>

<p>At last they reached the wide turn in the
road where the wagon must finally stop, at
the edge of the town field. The wagon
also came toiling upward, and now the good
horses might rest. So these were unhitched
from the wagon, and while one or two of the
men led them up the steep, paved street into
the village to find food and shelter for them,
the others attended to the house-wagon,
drawn close against the low stone wall
inclosing the field, placing great stones
against the wheels to steady it in its place.
Now was Natale’s hour and the dogs’, and
they understood this as well as he! Over
the low wall they scampered and down on
the soft, hot grass they lay, rolling over and
over down the gentle slope of the field until,
suddenly, Natale found himself landing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>directly upon his feet, with a whirring in his
head, and the sound of distressed barking
in his ears.</p>

<p>The dogs had had the wit to stop on the
very edge of a sharp descent which Natale
had not noticed, and now they stood on the
bank, half-a-dozen feet above him, their
forefeet firmly planted on the brink of the
grassy precipice, and their tufty tails high
in the air, begging with all their might to
know whether their dear little comrade were
hurt. Natale was not hurt, but the jar
of the descent gave him a queer feeling
under the waistband of his trousers, and
he sat down directly where he stood,
on the lower terrace, turning his back
upon the dogs.</p>

<p>A fringe of bushes threw a narrow band
of shade about him from above, and he
made up his mind to stay there till something
should be made ready for dinner.
He hoped he would not be wanted to fetch
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>anything from the village,&mdash;he was always
fetching something for somebody. He had
heard his mother calling to her husband to
bring a little meal for the polenta,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> when he
should finish stabling the horses, and he
knew there was wine left in the flask in the
wagon.</p>

<p>From where Natale sat he could look
directly down upon the roof of a house far
down by the stone bridge and could faintly
hear the rushing of the little river Lima over
the rocks. Presently he eased himself out
on the grass at full length, with his arms
crossed beneath his head. As he dropped
off to sleep, he was thinking how well it was
that there could be no performance in the
tent that evening. He was sure that
Arduina would laugh more than ever at
his stiff little feats on the circus carpet if
he should have to turn somersaults after
the long tramp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>Then Natale slept, with the great green
mountains closing around him, and Bianco
the black dog and Niero the white keeping
watch above his head from where they had
stretched themselves on the edge of the
terrace in the sun.</p>

<span class="smaller">NONNA</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">N</span>atale</span>, as will have been discovered
by this time, was an
Italian circus boy, a cheerful,
happy little soul, who loved his “profession”,
and whose ambition reached to the
giddy height of some day rivaling even
Antonio Bisbini in his wonderful trapeze
performances. He loved everything connected
with the life he led,&mdash;the long slow
journeyings through his beautiful Italy, the
camping out at night along the quiet roads,
the open-air loungings in some village
through the sunny days, until the evening
should come and the oil lamps be lighted in
the tent, and the people come crowding
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>in to see Arduina dance the tight rope, and
little Olga do her wonderful turns and
twists on the carpet, and to applaud Antonio
and the clown and the horses, and&mdash;yes,
and himself too, little Natale, stiff as
his short thin legs always were and hopeless,
as Arduina declared, in his bows and scrapes.</p>

<p>Besides the three musicians, there were
two families in the strolling company.
Giovanni Marzuchetti was the clown, also
the stepfather of Paulo, Arduina, Pietro,
Natale and little Maria, and husband of
Elvira, the black-haired mother of the five
children. This man had no children of his
own but was kind in his rough, clownish way
to Natale and the rest.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to understand why
Giovanni should have married Elvira and
her family, when it was known that the
woman brought to her husband a small
fortune in the shape of her own wonderful
skill as a rider of horses, and the little ones
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>as possible acrobats of the future. They
had been married for two years now, and
if Giovanni had counted largely upon his
ready-made family for speedy reënforcements
in the “ring”, he must have become
a little discouraged even by this time. It
is true that Paulo and Arduina were well
trained in the art of circus acting; but poor
Pietro, the middle-sized one, who was
twelve years old, was always ailing and
feeble. Sleeping out of doors in the marshy
regions had developed in his system a
chronic fever which could not be thrown
off, even with the aid of Nonna’s assiduous
doctoring, and lately the weakness had
settled in one leg and foot, threatening
permanent lameness.</p>

<p>Natale, who came next, was agile enough
when running about on his slim brown legs,
but his funny stiff-legged somersaults and
awkward antics in the ring were matters of
jesting among the whole troop. Poor little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>Natale, who did so wish to be like Antonio
Bisbini!</p>

<p>Lastly there was Maria, who was a mere
baby and as yet only just learning to stand
upright on her stepfather’s head.</p>

<p>But Antonio Bisbini, the father of the
other family, was the star of the little troop
of strolling players. Tall and lean and
muscular, he stood six feet two in his sandals.
His blond hair and skin and strong,
clear-cut features gave him the look of some
stern young Viking from the cold forests of
the North, yet this youthful-looking, ruddy
athlete was already the father of seven
young children.</p>

<p>No one in the company, not even the
clown, could hold a candle to Antonio in
looks or in graceful skill. Natale was sure
that the noblest and most beautiful figure
in all Italy was that of Antonio Bisbini as
he would step forth from behind the tent-curtain,
ready to thrill the spectators about
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>the ring. The flesh-colored tights clothing
his limbs showed to perfection their symmetry
and grace, relieved by the brilliantly
spangled hip garment of black velvet and
fringe, while the proud glance of his gray
eyes and the light tread of his feet never
failed to impress the beholder.</p>

<p>Antonio’s oldest, little red-haired Olga,
tumbled and danced with all a healthy
child’s love of activity and applause, and
Oh! how Natale envied her the perfect
“wheels” she turned, one after the other
with dizzying swiftness across the dusty
strip of carpet in the ring. But the rest of
Antonio’s seven were as yet too small to be
useful as tumblers or dancers, and Nonna’s
hands were always full, while their mother
did her daring dances in the air.</p>

<p>The three musicians, then, and Nonna
completed this strolling band of twenty,
with the two horses, the dogs and the
twisted-necked pony. Poor Caffero had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>grievously hurt his pretty neck one day
when very young, while tied in his stall and
leaping to reach his food from a manger
set cruelly high. Since then he had trotted
painfully through three years of going up
and down the earth, with his brown head and
long neck twisted far around to one side
without the power of righting them. Caffero
would have made a pretty part of the
show had not this accident befallen him.
As it was, he was good for little but helping
to guide the house-wagon along the weary
roads. Yet every one loved Caffero.</p>

<p>On the day of the arrival at Cutigliano
the two horses Tesoro and Il Duca were left
in their stalls in the village stables during
the whole afternoon, while Caffero was
brought down the steep village street and
allowed to graze in the public field. Nonna
herself had gone up for him with Tito in her
arms, after the midday meal of polenta, or
thick mush of yellow meal, had been eaten.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>As the trio passed through the narrow
street of the village, many heads turned to
wonder at the strangers&mdash;the gray-haired
woman, the bright-eyed child in her arms,
and poor Caffero, who always seemed
pulling against the leading rope and trying
to twist his head after something left
behind.</p>

<p>It was while Nonna, a little later, was
tying Caffero’s rope to a tree in the field that
she spied the two dogs asleep in the sun near
the edge of the terrace. As Tito recognized
them at the same time, and called them in
his baby voice, the grandmother added her
summons, and was rather astonished at
their failure to obey. They bounded to
their feet, it is true, but instead of scampering
to meet her, they stood still, quivering
with nervous excitement and waving their
tails in much perplexity. Then as Tito
began to fret and belabor the air with his
fists, Nonna started swiftly toward the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>dogs with something threatening in her
gait.</p>

<p>But where were they, those lazy brutes,
which a moment before had defied her and
then had promptly disappeared? A few
more hasty steps brought Nonna near
enough to the edge of the descent to see
both Niero and Bianco crouching over
Natale on the lower terrace. The boy had
been awakened by the sudden onset of his
faithful friends, and lay looking lazily upward
as Nonna and Tito peered over at
him.</p>

<p>“Natalino!” the old woman exclaimed,
and, at the word, Natale scrambled to his
feet.</p>

<p>“I am ready! Where am I to go?” he
asked hurriedly, preparing to creep up the
bank. But Nonna only laughed and
reached down a helping hand to the child,
as he clutched at the long grass for support.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>“Come and eat your polenta,” she said,
when Natale stood at her side, the dogs
panting close by. “I suppose they have
saved you a bite. Why did you run away?
Though, as for that, you were not missed
in all this hurly-burly of arriving. Now,
Niero, stand on your hind legs and beg.
See, Tito is fretting for you to do it&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But we haven’t a bone or a crust of
bread for him, Nonna,” Natale pleaded.
“See how sadly his eyes look at you.
Giovanni always gives him a bone.”</p>

<p>“There! take to your legs then, poor
thing!” Nonna cried in a friendly way
to the hungry dog. “Perhaps to-morrow
there will be a bone. Who knows?”</p>

<p>Natale ran off toward the wagon, followed
by the patient animals, who perhaps were
well assured that he was going to share with
them his own scanty heap of polenta.</p>

<p>The brown house on wheels leaned
slightly inward against the stone wall for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>security, as the hill’s incline was steep at
this point. The door opened directly upon
the top of the wall, which formed a broad
and convenient doorstep, reached from the
ground by a short ladder. About the
wagon and in the field close by everybody
was busy.</p>

<p>The great canvas of the tent had been
unpacked from the top of the wagon, and
the two women sat on the ground patching
the holes and thin places worn in it by long
use. Some of the men were making trips
back and forth from wagon and field,
carrying sections of board for inclosing
the ring. These were to be set up in their
places by and by, when Antonio should have
finished marking off the circle on the grass,
with the hole in the center for the tent pole.
There was nothing, as yet, for the children
to do but loll in the shadow of the wagon,
asleep or awake, and chatter among themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>As Natale and the dogs drew near,
Elvira, the boy’s mother, looked up from
her stitching and clapped her hand to her
forehead on seeing them.</p>

<p>“Natale! I had forgotten the child.
Little pest, where have you been, away
from us all, and your dinner? One would
think you had friends in the town and
had been taking your polenta in grander
houses than ours here.”</p>

<p>Natale replied to these mocking words
with only a rather naughty shrug of the
shoulders, and went to sit down on the
lowest step of the short ladder against the
wall.</p>

<p>“Give him his polenta, Arduina,” Nonna
called shrilly from a little way behind.
“He was asleep, Elvira, all tired out with
walking to-day as much as any man among
us. I keep my eyes open. Don’t scold the
boy.”</p>

<p>“One would think my Natale your own
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>grandson, Nonna,” Elvira replied, laughing
good-naturedly.</p>

<p>“All boys are as her own sons or grandsons,”
Nonna’s daughter-in-law interposed
carelessly, as the old woman passed on with
Tito, perhaps to see that Arduina gave
Natale his proper share of mush.</p>

<p>In Nonna’s big warm heart there was indeed
room for the sons and grandsons of
those who were too sparing of motherly
love and care for their own. The gray-haired
woman had long ago accepted this
wandering life for the sake of continuing
near to her only son, Antonio, the acrobat,
and Antonio’s children. When her boy at
the age of twenty-two had given up everything
that his mother thought of worth in
the world&mdash;home, a decent, quiet life in
it, books, school, a career as a priest&mdash;in
order to marry Cara, a rosy, lithe-limbed
rope-dancer out of Egypt, he had found that
his mother was not going to be given up
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>along with these. By and by, when the
babies began to come every year or two,
Nonna came to be appreciated even by the
fantastic daughter-in-law given her by
Antonio, while in the hearts of all the little
ones Nonna was&mdash;well, Nonna,&mdash;and
therefore everything good and patient and
sweet.</p>

<p>It was Nonna who cared for the ailing
Pietro, who rubbed Natale’s stiff ankles and
elbows with an ointment of her own invention
to limber them up, who thought to tuck
Olga’s long red hair out of the way when
practice time came and the curling locks
would have teased the little face and shoulders
turned upside down and hindside before.
It was Nonna who nursed the babies
and put them to bed while the mothers rode
the horses in the tent, and Nonna who led
the poor pony about to “fresh fields and
pastures new”, and Nonna who instructed
giddy-brained Arduina in the simple mysteries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
of concocting savory stews out of next to
nothing, and how to make corn meal for ten
do service as polenta for twice as many.
The little troop could not have done without
Nonna, no, indeed!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smaller">IN THE RING</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t</span> took all of that first day and most of the
next to get everything into shape for
an exhibition on the second night after
the arrival of the circus troop at Cutigliano.</p>

<p>The turf had been removed from the ring,
or round space inclosed by the low panels
of wood, and the tent pole erected, by the
time the canvas was mended and the side
curtains were ready to be hung.</p>

<p>The sun was just about to slip over the
mountain rim in the west when everything
was done, and it only remained to draw the
stout ropes and hoist the canvas into
position. Natale was generally on hand
when this was done, listening for the creaking
of the pulley at the top of the pole, as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>the dull yellow canvas slowly rose into
position, till, all at once, it spread like a
queer, pointed mushroom over the green
grass of the field.</p>

<p>It was a fortunate thing that there was
no wind that first evening, for if there had
been even a stiff breeze there would have
been no performance. A very little wind
caught under the canvas spread on that
exposed hillside before it was securely roped
into place might have carried it all away to
be stranded in the tops of the chestnut trees
below, and a new canvas for such a <i>circo</i>
as that would have cost certainly three
hundred francs.</p>

<p>When at last the tent was raised, Giovanni
hung above the entrance a broad
strip of blue canvas with clowns’ and
horses’ heads painted upon it, and the sign
in large letters: “Circo Equestre”, which
is Italian for “Circus with Horses.”</p>

<p>Lastly, figured curtains of pale green
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>calico were hung around the little vestibule,
so that outsiders who had not paid the
entrance fee might not peep inside and see
what was going on, without payment.</p>

<p>Now all was ready, and it was still early,
although almost dark in the field. Among
the mountains, where one lives perhaps at
the foot or even half-way up the slopes,
night falls early, because the sinking sun is
hidden from sight over the mountain tops
long before it really drops into the sea
behind them.</p>

<p>Yet it was not quite time to light the
lamps inside the tent, as the performance
was not to begin until half-past eight
o’clock. Cutigliano was full of Italians,
and a few English and Americans who had
left the hot cities behind, with their churches
and picture galleries and ruins, and had
come to the pleasant hotels of the ancient
mountain town to enjoy the fine air and
the beautiful chestnut woods during the hot
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>summer months. These visitors would not
be through with their dinners at the hotels
before eight o’clock, while the servants and
plain village folk would find a late hour
convenient for coming down the hill to the
yellow tent.</p>

<p>At seven o’clock, however, the three men,
with the big brass horn, the cornet and the
drum, climbed the stony street into the town
and made lively music in the little stone-paved
<i>piazzas</i>, or open squares, where the
children played in the sunset light.</p>

<p>By this time everybody in Cutigliano had
learned what had been going on down in the
field for the past two days, and many even
of the rich strangers had made up their
minds to go to see the show, partly out of
curiosity, partly out of kindly purpose
to help the strolling players. It had been
announced that six <i>soldi</i>, or cents, would
admit to the side of the ring where there
would be benches and a chair or two for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>seats, while three cents offered room on the
other side with a few boards and the green
grass as accommodation. Visitors were
invited to bring chairs for their sittings, if
possible.</p>

<p>The music sounded very brave and loud
as it returned down the very steepest street
of all, which ran between high walls past
Madame Cioche’s English <i>pension</i> or boarding-house
and ended in the field. As this
was a dark and even dangerous descent at
night for the unwary, Antonio had driven
a nail into a tree at the foot of the street,
and had hung there a smutty tin lamp, with
the light flaring and the smoke pouring
from two long spouts.</p>

<p>Nonna had beguiled most of the children
away from the tent by this time, and was
putting the youngest to bed in the wagon,
while the others rolled over the grass behind
the tent.</p>

<p>Natale was as busy as a bee in the small
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>tent which opened out of the large one.
This was the dressing room, and the different
costumes of the actors lay in heaps on
the boxes scattered about.</p>

<p>As half-past eight o’clock approached,
the boy became as excited as if this were to
be his first appearance in public, and he
kept lifting up the flap of curtain dividing
the two tents to see how fast the seats were
filling. The band had brought back a horde
of village children in its train, and though
few of these were possessed of the three
cents charged for children, they served to
keep up an appearance of bustle and enterprise
outside, where the band now played
the National Hymn of Italy gaily in the
light of the big lamp at the entrance.</p>

<p>Cara, the mother of Olga and the rest of
the seven, stood in the vestibule and took
in the great copper cents which by and by
began to pile up in the bowl on the table.
She was a very striking person to look at,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>with her coal-black hair frizzed bushily on
each side of her head, with her flashing
black eyes and her heavy brows, her red,
red lips and cheeks, and her scarlet and
black gown. No one dared to slip in behind
the rustling skirts or portly form of anybody
without paying, for her piercing eyes
seemed everywhere. Once or twice, when
the crowds about the doors seemed to
hesitate and to wonder whether, after all,
it were worth while to expend six or even
three cents for what was to be seen behind
the curtain, the pretty little figure of her
Olga was seen to flit, as if by accident,
across the vestibule, the full light streaming
over her little full blouse of yellow satin,
and her pink feet tripping as if on air.</p>

<p>The anxious half-hour of expectation
ended in the sight of a full circle surrounding
the ring, and then the band came inside and
all the performers slipped into the smaller
tent and hurried on their costumes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>The band played on; Arduina danced a
measured dance on the tight rope which
was stretched near the ground; the clown
made his funny jokes; Antonio performed
his clever feats on the bars; Elvira rode
the galloping horses with Cara dancing in
and out and everywhere, while Giovanni
cracked the whip and Paulo held the bar
for Il Duca to leap. The pantomime then
brought shouts of laughter and loud hand-clappings
from the spectators; and afterward
the tumbling began.</p>

<p>There was nothing that Olga loved so
much, and she showed it in every line of her
chubby, yet nimble little figure as she came
prancing into the ring, and then went heels
over head, over and over again, without
stopping to breathe, as far as the strip of
dusty carpet stretched. Then back again
she tumbled, only stopping to toss a stray
wisp of hair from her flushed face.</p>

<p>Next Arduina came tripping in, and over
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>and over she went too, not so gracefully and
daintily as Olga had done, for Arduina was
getting a little too large for that kind of
thing,&mdash;a great girl of fifteen years.</p>

<p>The clown followed Arduina, dressed in
his clumsy suit of black and white, and what
a farce his tumbling was, to be sure; only
the spectators must have known that he
failed in order to make them laugh at his
awkwardness, and make merry they did.</p>

<p>Somehow Natale never quite enjoyed the
laughter which often accompanied his own
performances, and now his time had come.</p>

<p>“<i>Ecco!</i> Natalino!” called his stepfather,
the clown, rushing behind the curtain
all breathless and covered with dust.
“Over and over and over you go, youngster,
without stopping to sneeze between!”</p>

<p>Natale was such a little fellow, so much
smaller than Olga even, that many of the
faces outside the ring softened at sight of
him, as he darted out into the light of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>lamps and then halted to make his funny
little salute. He was dressed in imitation
of the clown, in long black trousers and a
tailed black coat, with a pointed white
waistcoat reaching below his waist. With
an earnest seriousness very different from
Olga’s smiling grace, Natale turned his first
somersault, paused on his back, turned
another jerkily, while the little boys watching
him hooted, and a ripple of laughter ran
around the ring. Back again he came,
however, his thin black legs sprawling in
air, and his pale little face flushing with the
exertion. On his feet again, he clapped one
hand to the back of his neck, bobbed his
head to the spectators, and trotted off
behind the friendly curtain, satisfied that
he had, at least, done as well as usual, and
pleased with the loud clapping attending
his exit. Indeed, there was a clapping and
a calling out of something with laughing
voices.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>“<i>Il picino! Il picino!</i>”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>“You will have to go back, Natalino,”
laughed the clown. “Salute them and
stand on your head, boy, but don’t lose it
on the way.”</p>

<p>The music played loudly, and Natale
stepped gravely back again, made his odd
little bow, and fell over on his hands as the
first step toward standing on his head.
Poor, stiff little legs! It took more than
one effort to throw them into an upright
position above his head, but finally he really
did accomplish it, and stood thus several
seconds while the shouting and laughing
went on.</p>

<p>When Natale had disappeared a second
time behind the curtain, there were a few
grave faces among the laughing ones looking
on. An English lady whispered to her
companion and sighed.</p>

<p>“The poor little fellow is evidently afraid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>to disobey that dreadful clown,” she said.
“Did you see how he trembled as the man
stood over him, when he tried to stand on
his head? Something ought to be done to
put a stop to this, Betty.”</p>

<p>“The child looks weak, as if he were not
very well fed,” Betty answered, “but I do
not think he looks unhappy. And the
clown was certainly smiling, and seemed to
be standing by as if to help the little boy
accomplish his wonderful feat, I thought.
Don’t distress yourself, Aunty. He is just
learning, it may be, and they bring him in
to contrast him with that little beauty who
turned the ‘wheels.’ Send the boy some
good bread and meat to-morrow, and that
will be better for him than our empty
sympathy.”</p>

<p>But “Aunty” was not satisfied, as we
shall see.</p>

<p>The last act of the evening again brought
Natale to the fore. The big spotted horse,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>Il Duca, was again brought into the ring,
and after he had cantered gaily around
inside the ring many times, to the music
of a schottisch, striking terror to the ladies
occupying the front seats, with their knees
pressed against the low barrier, the clown
suddenly called a halt and caught the
bridle of the panting steed. Gently the
solemn strains of the “Dead March”
sounded through the tent, and Il Duca fell
slowly and painfully upon his knees, and
then rolled over upon the ground, apparently
dying. The light dust of the ring
stirred under the beast’s laboring nostrils,
and deep groans issued from his throat,
while Giovanni stood mournfully by and
the music played on.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE FESTIVAL OF SAN LORENZO</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">S</span>uddenly</span> the small black figure of
Natale appeared, kneeling at the
horse’s side, although no one had
seen him slip in. With his hands clasped in
distress, he lifted his voice in such a disconsolate
wail that even Betty started and
wondered if the horse could be really dying.</p>

<p>The solemn march was still sounding in
the tent, and before speaking the clown gave
the spectators full time to take in the tragic
tableau. Then he exclaimed briskly:</p>

<p>“What are you crying about, boy?”</p>

<p>“Because our horse is dead.”</p>

<p>“Do you think he is quite dead, Natale?”</p>

<p>“Oh, quite,” wailed the child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>“Get up and feel his pulse, boy. If there
is any pulse he is not dead.”</p>

<p>Natale went nearer and took one of the
great hoofs of the horse fearlessly into his
little hands, and felt for the “pulse.”</p>

<p>“Well, what do you find?” asked the
clown impatiently.</p>

<p>“There isn’t any pulse,” the little fellow
wailed again, laying down the big black
hoof with the utmost tenderness.</p>

<p>“Too bad,” quoth the clown, taking his
seat deliberately on the prostrate horse,
which lay as motionless as if certainly dead.
Then, all in a moment, Natale’s manner
changed, and he skipped around in front of
Giovanni, remarking glibly that the gentleman
had found a beautiful sofa to sit upon.</p>

<p>“And I shall have a kiss to prove that the
beast is not dead,” exclaimed the clown,
chirruping a little and smacking his lips.
And the great brown head of the horse
lifted itself from the dust, the graceful neck
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>turned, and Il Duca actually kissed his
master, then scrambled hastily to his feet
as if glad for that job to be over, while
Giovanni hurried him out of the ring.</p>

<p>“Such silly jokes!” commented Mrs.
Bishop, otherwise Aunty, as the performance
ended, and the rollicking crowd poured
out of the tent. “Think of my having spent
two whole hours listening to them, and all
on pins too, for fear that poor, ill-used child
should be forced to do some other unchristian
thing.”</p>

<p>“But, Aunty, what did you expect when
you came?” Betty asked impatiently.
“Surely the little show was not bad, and
there was actually nothing but what was
quite decent in every way.”</p>

<p>“I call it ‘bad’ to beat and starve children
into turning themselves into monkeys.”</p>

<p>“If people would not go to see the
‘monkeys’ it would be stopped,” was
Betty’s retort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I am sure I only went to oblige
Mrs. Choky,” Aunty said in an injured tone.
“She said she thought we ought to encourage
the poor people on their first night. But it
will be my last night there, as I shall very
soon inform her. ‘Encourage’ them to
martyrize that poor child, indeed!”</p>

<p>From the first performance in Cutigliano,
therefore, Natale’s trouble began, although
he did not know it. Contented and tired he
lay down in his corner of the brown house
on wheels and went to sleep, while the men
let down the big yellow canvas of the large
tent and furled it about the pole. But
first, he ate his supper of macaroni with
the rest of the actors, gathered in the small
tent behind. Midnight suppers were the
rule on the nights when there were performances,
as it would have been at the
risk of upsetting their stomachs in more
ways than one to eat food beforehand.</p>

<p>Later, the stars kept quiet watch above
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>the little encampment, where even Pietro
slept well, with the open house door admitting
the fresh air of the mountains.</p>

<p>For ten days the yellow “mushroom”
spread over the grass of the field, although
very much in the way of the fine city gentlemen,
playing at ball with bats like tambourines.
The noisy music at night and the
cheering in the tent may have kept the
invalids in the nearest boarding-houses
awake and nervous, and the people at large
may have grown tired of the performances
which they soon learned by heart, but no
one felt inclined to hustle the poor people
away, and no one grumbled except Mrs.
Bishop.</p>

<p>There was something pathetic about the
clown in his everyday dress, his gayety and
paint all gone and the deep lines of his face
showing too plainly in the garish light of
day, as he pottered about the tent, adjusting ropes,
and keeping off the village boys
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>who would throw stones upon the old
canvas, or play hide and seek among the
curtains. It gave one a queer feeling, also,
to fancy the drooping figure of Pietro, with
his pure little face like alabaster, a member
of the “wicked circus troop.”</p>

<p class="p2b">This child was perhaps twelve years old,
and he had the face of an angel. He had
begun to lose his daily feverishness after a
week in the mountains, and was soon able
to limp, and later to run feebly about the
field with the village boys.</p>

<span class="center"><i>Page <a href="#Page_45">45.</a></i></span></p>

<p class="p2">But Natale, spidery little Natale, interested
every one more even than did Pietro.
Yet he looked only an everyday lad during
the long summer days, when he trotted up
and down, to and from the town, carrying
now a bowl of this, now a flask of that,
but always carrying something. To most
people he seemed as happy as the days were
long, just as ready for a chat with a strange
foreigner who might address him in broken
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>Italian as with old Sora Teresa who sold
fruit and vegetables in the piazza, and who
sometimes presented him with a ripe red
tomato, or a slice of melon all green and
pink.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Bishop looked down upon the
tent from the garden terrace of Madame
Cioche’s boarding-house every day, and
slowly formed a plan for making Natale’s
life happier. Poor little Natale!</p>

<p>The terrace garden above the field was
shaded with plane trees and the mountain
ash, and the grass was soft and richly green.
Each afternoon some of the boarders would
gather at the palings on the edge of this
garden and watch the gentlemen playing
ball below, and the village boys imitating
Olga and Natale at turning somersaults and
wheels.</p>

<p>One afternoon, while the boarders were
drinking tea under the ash trees, with the
berries overhead turning red, and the sun
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>streaming across the croquet ground, there
came a knock at the side door of the boarding-house.
Madame Cioche herself opened
the door, and there stood Natale, smiling
up into her face, with the old blue hat set
far back on his dark curls. The lady
noticed that the boy’s face was very clean.</p>

<p>“Happy day to you,” he said brightly,
using the peasant form of address, “and
my mamá says will you please send her a cup
of tea? She is feeling ill to-day.”</p>

<p>Of course Madame Cioche would send the
tea, fetching it herself from the dining room
and handing it to the boy. But she kept
Natale a moment to ask how it was that his
mamá could possibly like tea.</p>

<p>“Oh, but she has it every day when we
are in Egypt,” was the reply. “And to-day
her head aches. Thank you, Signora.”
And Natale went off down the hill carrying
the big cup as carefully as his bowls and
flasks were always carried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Bishop overheard the word “Egypt”
and sighed.</p>

<p>The next day was Sunday and an important
festival, being the day of San
Lorenzo. A great harvest of <i>soldi</i> was
expected, as peasants from all the mountain
villages would come trooping in that day,
to go to high mass in the church under the
old mountain firs, and to take part in the procession
of the “saints” in the afternoon. So
there was, of course, to be a performance in
the tent that day, but in the afternoon this
time, just after the procession, instead of
in the evening, when everybody would be
tired or toiling homeward along the dark
mountain ways. As there was nothing for
him to do about the tent, however, until
five o’clock should boom from the stone
tower of the church, Natale made good use
of his legs during the whole day, for there
was much to see.</p>

<p>Betty Bishop had tossed a penny into his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>hands down over the garden palings that
very Sunday morning. Perhaps she was
thinking of some little child at home in
England who would be clamoring for a
penny to carry to Sunday school, but
Natale had no thought of dropping his
precious two <i>soldi</i> into the priest’s collecting
bag in the church.</p>

<p>The <i>piazza</i> was too fascinating a place to
be passed by, when one held a penny of his
own fast in his fist. With the dogs on each
side of him, therefore, Natale spent most
of the day above in the town, going from
booth to booth, and in fancy spending his
money over and over again. There were
sweets of various kinds offered for sale on
the little tables along the steep, narrow
streets, and booths of everything from
coarse stuffs and ready-made clothing to
breastpins of gay mosaic work and filigree
rings.</p>

<p>Everywhere Natale was jostled by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>peasants who all through the morning had
flocked to the town, dressed in their best
clothes and wearing holiday looks on their
faces. The women and girls wore gay
kerchiefs on their heads, with brilliant
borderings and flowing ends, while even the
men wore bits of vivid color in the shape of
gorgeous neck scarfs spread over their white
shirt fronts. Mingled with these walked the
lords and ladies of a higher class dressed
according to the fashion plates of Paris, and
seeming to enjoy the hot sunshine and the
gay restiveness of the multitude as much as
the plainer folk. All day the frolic and
prayers and the music of the town band and
the church organ went on in the little town,
till mid-afternoon, when there fell a hush
over all and a great expectation.</p>

<p>Natale had not a very good place from
which to see the procession pass, for he
stood between a very stout peasant woman
and a visiting priest in his full black gown.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>Still, he managed to peer from under their
elbows without attracting their attention,
and he was content, holding securely in one
hand, meanwhile, the balloon whistle which
he had finally purchased with his penny.
The pretty red bubble of rubber had not
yet burst, and Natale was happy in its
possession. The handful of crisp wafers
flavored with anise seed, which he had
almost bought&mdash;so very foolish he had
been&mdash;would have been eaten long ere
this, and it would be as if he had never had
a penny of his own tossed over the fence to
him by a smiling young lady, but now he
still had the whistle!</p>

<p>On they came, the straggling company
of men and boys, dressed in white gowns
and cowls, and bearing huge lighted
candles in their hands. Natale thought he
would like to have been one of the two boys
bearing the immense candlesticks of brass;
yet, after all, the candlesticks must be very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>heavy, and they were propped very uncomfortably
on the little boys’ stomachs,
and very red and perspiring were the little
boys’ faces.</p>

<p>Natale thought the men’s feet ugly and
clumsy, showing below the white gowns,
and their harsh, chanting voices made him
shiver. But he could not follow the awkward
marching steps of the peasants with
laughing looks as some of the onlookers
were doing, for here, behind the banners and
crucifixes, came two very curious-looking
objects.</p>

<p>“<i>Ecco!</i> the dead saints!” he exclaimed
softly to himself. “How heavy they must
be in the glass boxes on the men’s shoulders.
Yet our Antonio Bisbini would never bend
so under a small box as those men do.
Ah! but the little girls are pretty, so pretty
in their white veils, and scattering flowers
before the saints.”</p>

<p>The crowd closed in upon the end of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>procession now, and Natale could see no
more, as he was nearly overturned where
he stood. After a breathless moment or
two, he found himself left in peace and
quiet under the great old fir trees in front
of the church, with the crowd all gone and
Nicro and Bianco with them.</p>

<p>Nonna had told him to be sure and see
the saints, if possible, so he went into the
dark old church and sat down on a low chair
to wait for the procession to return. He
knew that San Lorenzo and Sant’ Aurelio
would surely be brought back to spend the
night in the church, perhaps in front of the
candle-lighted altar, and he wished to
please Nonna. It was dark and quiet in
his corner under the organ gallery, and it
was a very easy and natural thing for a tired
little boy to fall asleep in that quiet place.</p>

<p>When the procession returned after half
an hour, it was without the blare of trumpets
and the crash of organ music, though for a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>long while shuffling feet passed in and out.
This continued until everybody had looked
at the two saints robed in costly garments
and reposing now at full length on their
satin cushions within their caskets of glass
set before the altar. Many touched the
rich cloths draping the caskets with reverent
fingers, and pressed kisses on the cold
glass before passing out into the radiant
sunset light.</p>

<p>When Natale waked, the church doors
were still open, but only one light swung
before the high altar, and there was no
trace anywhere of dead saint or living soul.
He groped his way among the disarranged
chairs and benches quite to the altar rail,
but even the empty biers had been borne
away to some inner recess of the church, so,
with a dread that he had overslept awaking
in his mind, Natale found his way out of
the church again.</p>

<p>The purple bloom of evening was creeping
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>up the mountain sides, and a star glowed in
the sky. Just above the mountain line in
the west the crescent moon hovered, as if
uncertain over which side to sink. The
dread in Natale’s mind had nothing to do
with saints or dark churches. On awaking,
his first sensation had been a fear that he
might have missed the afternoon performance
in the beloved tent, and now, standing
outside the church in the dusk, he knew that
he had missed it!</p>

<p>With a sob in his throat he turned his
face from the telltale sky, and fled through
the village down to the field. When he
reached the wagon,&mdash;for he would not go
to the tent, quiet now and unlighted,&mdash;the
first words he heard came from Olga:</p>

<p>“Have you not heard, Natalino? Giovanni
has lost a hundred francs! Somebody
stole them when he changed his coat
in the little tent. Yes, I know you were not
there! We wondered where you could be!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="smaller">A GIFT FOR THE CIRCUS</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">N</span>atale</span> held his breath with horror.
One hundred francs lost! And he
not at hand to hear of it, to help
look for the money, among the very first?
He could not ask Olga how it had happened,
because his heart was almost too
disappointed and sore for words. He sat
down on the wall, with his back toward
the tent, and waited for her to tell all
about the loss, although he was not at all
certain that she would condescend to do
so. In fact, she said not a word more,
but stood in front of Natale, wondering
not a little at his unusual quiet.</p>

<p>“You are sulky!” she exclaimed finally,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>“and Giovanni is very angry with you. So
am I, for I had to feel Il Duca’s pulse, and
I did not like it at all. Suppose he had
kicked me, seeing that it was not you.”</p>

<p>“Il Duca was dead!” Natale retorted,
with a twinkle in his eye, if only Olga could
have seen it. “He would not know you
from me!”</p>

<p>“Dead!” cried Olga. “I believe you
truly do think that, when you set up your
crying, Natale; really I did not do it half
so well as you,” she confessed honestly.</p>

<p>“But you ‘wheel’ much better than I
do,” Natale conceded with ready generosity
in return.</p>

<p>“Il Duca did not shut his eyes at all,”
Olga went on, nodding assent to Natale’s
remark, “and I am sure he <i>winked</i> at me,
Natale, just to frighten me. It did not
take <i>me</i> long to feel his pulse! But where
were you, Natalino, all the time? Nonna
said she was afraid some of the peasants had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>stolen you and carried you off, when Niero
and Bianco came home without you.”</p>

<p>“As if they would have let anybody steal
me! Olga, I went to sleep in the church,
waiting for the saints to come back, and
when I waked it was dark, almost as dark
as this!”</p>

<p>“Oho! then you must have been in the
church when Arduina and I went in to look
at the saints. Arduina said&mdash;but you
must not dare to tell anybody&mdash;she said
that she did not believe there were any
bones under the saints’ fine velvet robes
because San Lorenzo had a hand of pink
wax, and the rest of him looked rather
stuffed. But do not tell Nonna, Natale!”</p>

<p>“Arduina is very wicked,” said Natale,
but he laughed with Olga, and then felt
much better, and as if he could ask about
the losing of the money.</p>

<p>They were in a little nook to themselves,
behind the wagon, and no one heeded them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p>“<i>Ecco!</i> it was this way,” Olga began,
charmed to be the first to recount the misfortune
to Natale, who was usually behind
none in his knowledge of the affairs of the
company. “Just when Giovanni was going
in to do the clown in the first dance on
the rope, the Signor Barbera, the stable
man, came behind the big tent with his bill
for keeping the horses, and Giovanni took
the big pocketbook out of the pocket of
his coat&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know which pocket,” Natale
interposed. “I saw him put the money
there this morning.”</p>

<p>“Well, the signor could not make the
change, so he told Giovanni it was all right,
and any time would do, and then Antonio
rang the bell for Giovanni, and he just put
the pocketbook back in his coat and hung
the coat on the nail in the little tent, and
hurried on the black coat, and went into the
ring.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, and then?” asked Natale breathlessly.</p>

<p>“When he came back, he saw his coat on
the ground, and he knew he had hung it up.
‘How comes my coat on the ground?’ he
said, very loud indeed, and your mamá told
him he must have put it there himself.
But he did not hear her, because he was
shaking the coat and feeling in the pocket,&mdash;but
there was nothing there!</p>

<p>“We made a great fuss about it,”
Olga ended, shrugging her shoulders and
throwing up her hands, “but what was
the use?”</p>

<p>Natale was silent with dismay. A hundred
francs meant so much. It was all
that they had made during the ten days’
stay at Cutigliano, and now it was gone,
in a moment.</p>

<p>“The stable man?” he questioned in a
distressed tone of voice, and very low.</p>

<p>“No, Giovanni said it could not have been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>the signor. He is a rich man and honest,
everybody says.”</p>

<p>So subdued were they all over the trouble
of the afternoon that not even Elvira
thought it worth while to scold the quiet
boy who presently slipped in among the
little crowd of players in the tent, deep in
fruitless discussion over their grievous loss.
They had had a crowded tent that afternoon,
and the receipts had been so good that
this evening would have been one of rejoicing
if only the money for the labors of the
ten other days and nights had been again
safe in Giovanni’s pocket. There was not
the slightest clew to the thief, as no stranger
had been known to enter the tent, and
Giovanni had even interviewed the Signor
Barbera from outside the doorway. It had
been necessary to be on the lookout for
possible thieving, as the field was crowded
all the afternoon with strange peasants,
attracted by the band music and the big
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>yellow tent, and by peddlers with their
wares. One very decent-looking peddler
had begged pretty, vain Arduina to look at
his beautiful jewelry and ribbons, but she
had refused him entrance very reluctantly,
and Giovanni himself had noticed how
patiently and decorously the man had
turned away. He had worn a red fez cap
over his long black hair, and his bushy
black beard had reached nearly to his waist.</p>

<p>“I saw him!” Emilio, one of the musicians
exclaimed, “and his legs were as
crooked as Pietro’s, only they bent out at
the knee instead of in!” There was a laugh
at this sally, but Pietro frowned and muttered
something about Emilio’s having
little right to criticize the legs of others.</p>

<p>“I met such a man as I came out of the
church in the crowd,” said Nonna, hastening
to speak that a dispute might be avoided.
“He walked very well notwithstanding his
poor, bent legs, and he asked me if he were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>too late to get a glimpse of the blessed
relics. A politer man I never saw, though
Tito was afraid of him, and began to cry
when the man snapped his fingers at him.”</p>

<p>Poor Natale felt so left out in the cold
with this talk that he could not bear it long,
and was just about to creep away, down to
his corner in the wagon, when a strange
hand lifted a corner of the tent flap, and a
strange voice inquired for “<i>Il piccolo
Natale</i>.”</p>

<p>“Some ladies up at the house there have
a little present for you all,” the black-coated
Italian butler of the boarding-house
announced, peering in upon the group
gathered about the sputtering lamp inside,
“but they wish to send it down by the boy,
Natale.”</p>

<p>Then Natale was himself again, and without
demur or bashfulness presented himself
to the servant.</p>

<p>“It is well you turned up in time, Natalino,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
said the clown, giving him a little
shove toward the dignified butler waiting
just outside. “Perhaps Olga would not
have done, in this case. Off with you to the
<i>forestieri</i><a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> above!”</p>

<p>Many a boy would have been abashed at
finding himself the center of such a group as
awaited Natale in the hallway of the house
in the garden. But Natale was too well
accustomed to an array of faces fixed upon
him to make the least show of bashfulness.
The lady of the house, whose pleasant face
he knew very well, laid her hand on his
shoulder and asked him kindly in Italian if
anything had been heard of the money lost
that afternoon, and her soft, dark eyes
looked sympathetically into his own.</p>

<p>“No, signora, and my papá says we shall
never see a <i>soldo</i> of it again,” was Natale’s
prompt answer.</p>

<p>“Ask him if they have any idea of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>person who stole it,” Betty Bishop suggested
in English, and Madame Cioche did so.
Natale’s answer to this was more expressive
than polite perhaps, for without words he
simply raised his shoulders as high as
possible, pressing his elbows against his
sides, and spreading his hands wide to indicate
the complete ignorance of his people
as to the coward who had taken their hard-earned
money. And the drawn-down
corners of his mouth so changed the expression
of his face that one would hardly
have known him.</p>

<p>“Who would have believed the child
could make himself so ugly,” Mrs. Bishop
exclaimed. “Have you no tongue, boy,
to answer properly?”</p>

<p>But as English words were far less intelligible
to Natale than Caffero’s whinny,
or Niero’s bark, he only looked up into
Madame Cioche’s face and smiled.</p>

<p>“There! it is a bonny little face after
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>all,” said that lady, “and now shall we give
him the money and send him away?”</p>

<p>“No, let me speak to him first,” demanded
Mrs. Bishop, “and you, Mrs.
Choky, must interpret. Ask him if he likes
to be a wicked little circus boy.”</p>

<p>“Aunty!” gasped Betty.</p>

<p>“Never mind, I have a reason for my
question, Betty. Hush, what does he
say?”</p>

<p>“Do you like to play in the circus, dear?”
asked Mrs. Cioche’s kind voice, in Italian.</p>

<p>Natale’s eyes shone.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, signora! And when I am a
man, I shall be another Antonio Bisbini.”</p>

<p>“He says he likes it very much, Mrs.
Bishop,” was the interpretation.</p>

<p>“Already corrupted, poor boy, and so
young!” the old lady sighed, while Betty
laughed outright.</p>

<p>“Ask him if he would not like better to
have some nice clothes, and go to school,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>and grow up to be a decent man some day,
Mrs. Choky.” That lady hesitated a little
before putting this question into Italian.</p>

<p>“What does she say to me?” Natale
asked, his brown eyes twinkling as he looked
from one to the other, his teeth showing
white between his red lips. Natale’s was
a wide, good-natured mouth, very prone to
laugh upon small provocation.</p>

<p>“She wants to know if you would not like
to go to school, and learn to read and write,”
said Madame Cioche.</p>

<p>“And leave the <i>circo</i>?” Natale asked with
a gasp.</p>

<p>“Yes, you could not go to school unless
you should stop in one place, you know.”</p>

<p>“And not travel about with the horses
and wagon any more, and leave Nonna?”</p>

<p>“Of course, Natale. But she is only asking
you about it, <i>carino</i>, so do not look so
troubled.”</p>

<p>Natale laughed then, and happily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>“She wanted to find out how much I love
the <i>circo</i>!” he exclaimed. “Please tell her,
signora. You know, how we all love the
<i>circo</i>!”</p>

<p>“I think I do, Natale. He does not want
to go to school, Mrs. Bishop,” turning to the
eager old lady, “because he loves his life
with the circus and his own people too
much.”</p>

<p>“And he does not wish to leave his grandmother,”
chimed in Betty who had very
cleverly picked up a good deal of Italian
during a winter and summer in Italy, and
all grandmothers are Nonnas in that land.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bishop was silent for a moment, her
gaze taking in every detail of Natale’s little
figure standing sturdily before her, dusty
shoes, and rough peasant leggings, velveteen
trousers, faded blue blouse, and rumpled
curls, with the old hat held in one sun-burned
hand. His face was not so clean as
usual now, and there were tired circles about
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>his eyes. It had been a long, exciting summer’s
day.</p>

<p>“Children&mdash;especially boys&mdash;do not
know what is best for themselves,” she said
presently, bending her brows, but not in the
least frightening Natale, “and I am not going
to give up my plan, for this baby’s
nonsense. Why, he cannot be over eight
years old, at the most.”</p>

<p>“Here, Natale,” said Madame Cioche,
judging that the interview might well be
concluded, and handing the boy a small
packet. “Take this to your papá, and tell
him that the ladies and gentlemen in my
house have heard of the loss of the money,
and are sending him thirty-five francs as
a little present. Can you carry it safely?”</p>

<p>Again Natale’s sweet smile broke over his
face, but he only nodded happily in reply,
tucking the money away in the bosom of his
blouse.</p>

<p>“Ask him how long they are going to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>stay,” Mrs. Bishop called after Madame
Cioche, who was going to the gate with
Natale.</p>

<p>“He says that the <i>sindaco</i>&mdash;the mayor&mdash;has
offered them the use of the field for
another week,” Madame Cioche said, her
eyes glowing, as she returned to the hall.
“I am glad of that, as the poor creatures
will need all they can make here, now.”</p>

<p>“I call it a sort of punishment, their losing
the money when playing on Sunday,” Mrs.
Bishop said severely, and one or two other
English ladies nodded their approval of this
speech. “And I think the whole business
wrong and that it ought to be discouraged.
I was not at all sure about the propriety of
giving my francs to your little collection,
Mrs. Choky.”</p>

<p>“Would it have been more Christian to
have let them suffer, perhaps for food, and
the poor beasts too?” the hostess asked,
pausing on her way through the hall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<p>“But surely you think circusing wrong
and <i>un</i>christian?” the disputative old lady
exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Aunty, do be quiet,” cried Betty
warmly. “I am sure you ought not to
dispute ‘on Sunday’! Besides,” she added,
as everybody laughed, and two or three
softly applauded, “they make their living
that way, and we cannot change them into
farmers, or preachers. But I think it is
always wrong not to help honest people who
are in trouble.”</p>

<p>“If they <i>are</i> honest,” Mrs. Bishop remonstrated,
but under her breath, this time,
for Madame Cioche’s eyes were sparkling,
and she seemed waiting to speak.</p>

<p>“Those poor creatures down there deserve
nothing but praise,” she said stoutly;
“they are quiet folks, who teach their children
obedience and keep themselves
remarkably clean and mended. If they
make their living in a way we do not approve,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
we cannot change them, as Miss
Betty says, but we can feed them when they
are hungry, and that seems to me not
‘unchristian’!”</p>

<p>“I am afraid she has a little temper,”
said Mrs. Bishop, as their hostess went
upstairs.</p>

<p>“A temper I like!” exclaimed a gentleman
who had before kept silent, looking up
from his book. “But do you still think of
carrying out your plan, Mrs. Bishop?”</p>

<p>“If possible, certainly,” was the reply,
while Betty, shaking her head, walked out
into the garden. There, under the stars,
she stood looking down upon the tent in the
field. There was no wind, and the heavens
were fair, so the canvas had not been furled.</p>

<p>“I should like it myself,” she murmured.
“What a fascinating life to live! Camping
out the year round in Italy, with no troublesome
dressing four times a day, no tiresome
<i>table-d’hôte</i> dinners at night. But after all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>I should not like to be that girl,&mdash;Arduina,
they call her. Of course, Aunty is right
about the rope dancing and other ‘circusing’
on Sunday, only she need not be quite
so fussy over what we certainly cannot help.
Poor Natale! how disturbed he did look
when Madame Cioche asked him about
going to school!”</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">N</span>atale</span> lay flat on the grass, his
face hidden on his arms, and his
feet rebelliously kicking the ground.
The added week granted by the mayor
had passed, and the circus-wagon was
about to move on.</p>

<p>“You are only to try it, child, and if it
will not do, you can come back to us. One
year is not a hundred.”</p>

<p>No reply from Natale.</p>

<p>“You ought to think, sometimes, of how
many mouths your stepfather has to fill,”
another voice began. “Five children, and
not one his own.”</p>

<p>“Why did he marry us then?” fiercely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>muttered Natale, but without lifting his
head, so perhaps nobody heard.</p>

<p>“You will have new clothes and shoes!”</p>

<p>“And a new hat, Natalino!”</p>

<p>“And you will learn to read much faster
than I can teach you ’Lino, with all the
practicings and the journeyings. Perhaps
you will even learn to be as clever as my
Antonio was, before&mdash;” Nonna ended with
a sigh instead of more words.</p>

<p>The women and girls were in the side
tent, busied about dinner, and Nonna
would not finish her sentence in the presence
of Antonio’s wife.</p>

<p>“I would rather be our Antonio than&mdash;than
the King or the <i>principino</i>,”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Natale
cried helplessly. Then he sat up on the
worn grass, and faced them all, tearful but
resolute. “I shall not stay here with the
priest and go to school, mamá,” he said
earnestly. “You shall not leave me behind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
and take Maria and Pietro and the
rest.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps we can persuade Giovanni to
leave little Bianco with you, if the good
priest does not object,” Nonna whispered
in his ear.</p>

<p>“No, I shall go with you,” returned
Natale.</p>

<p>“Ah! what is all this?” came suddenly
in Giovanni’s gruff, good-natured tones.
“What? Natale will not stay? The beautiful
little star of the ring will not leave us
in the darkness?” And the clown entered
the tent and flung himself down, laughing,
beside the little boy.</p>

<p>“Hurry with the polenta, Arduina,” he
called to his stepdaughter, who had lifted
her hot face from the steam of the mush pot
to laugh at the man’s rough wit. “The
biggest hole yet torn in the tent must be
mended this afternoon, and the canvas is
almost dry now in this wind. If it had not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>rained yesterday, and if the wind had not
played us such a trick on the very eve of
our going, we should have made our fortunes
yesterday. A cattle fair does not
offer itself every day, with its crowd of
country bumpkins who never saw a man
in tights. Now, that will do, Natale,”
turning to the boy, who was sniffing
audibly. “Hours ago it was all decided,
and there is nothing more to be said.”</p>

<p>“Then I am <i>not</i> to stay in this horrid
place, Giovanni&mdash;papá&mdash;”</p>

<p>“‘Giovanni&mdash;papá&mdash;!’ No more of
these tears, Natalino. You are to stay in
this beautiful place, and after polenta, you
are to go up to the garden and thank the
lady.”</p>

<p>With a loud, rebellious howl, Natale
sprang to his feet and rushed out into the
open air. Nor did he stop until he stood
among the briar bushes below the garden
palings. Clenching his small grimy fists, he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>stood there looking up toward the many-windowed
<i>pension</i> and shook them vehemently,
while his shrill voice cried out
passionately:</p>

<p>“I shall not stay here! I shall not go to
school! I like my old hat, and I want
Nonna to teach me to read. I shall never
thank you, <i>never</i>, <span class="allsmcap">NEVER</span>, NEVER!”</p>

<p>He had seen no one in the garden, and
was only addressing the whole houseful of
his enemies up there in the big yellow building
with the staring windows. Why should
they interfere with him? Why should
any one be trying to make him wretched,&mdash;the
most wretched boy in all Italy?</p>

<p>“Heyday! what’s all this about?” and
a white-haired old man, speaking from the
garden, came close to the palings and looked
over at the small, threatening figure among
the bushes. “I cannot understand your
gibberish, if you are talking to me. You
would better go away now, little boy, or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>some of your people will come and whip
you.”</p>

<p>“How suddenly you stopped the noise,
Mr. Grantly,” exclaimed Betty, coming up
to his side. “Who was it? Why, Aunty’s
little protégé, Natale! How pitiful he
looks, walking away as if his feelings were
hurt. You must have frightened him.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it, ma’am. He frightened
<i>me</i> with his fierce little voice. It came
suddenly, just as I was dropping off to
sleep in my chair. It is a relief to have
them moving on this afternoon, with their
horns and drum. But that boy stays,
some one tells me. Is it possible that the
family agreed to give him up? I have
understood that the Italians cling to each
other as much as even we do in America
or England. Do they really leave the
child?”</p>

<p>“For more money than he could ever
bring them by his somersaulting, yes,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>Betty answered. “Sometimes I think
Aunty really does not know what to do
with her money,” the girl went on confidentially
to the old gentleman, who was
listening with interest. “Now, that boy
has no desire to be taken away from ‘the
evil life he is leading’ in Aunty’s estimation,
and he does not wish to be sent to school
and become ‘a decent man.’”</p>

<p>“Ah! tell me the whole plan, now. I
heard something of it a few days ago.”</p>

<p>“It is very simple&mdash;all but getting Natale
to agree to being imposed upon,” Betty went
on a little vexedly. “Aunty has had the
stepfather and the mother up here several
times this past week to be talked to, and
an old woman who seems to be the grandmother
of them all. Miss Lorini has done
all the interpreting, and also saw the priest
about it, as Madame Cioche would not.
They have agreed to leave Natale here for
one year; he is to be taken care of by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>priest’s mother, and to be sent to school and
made ‘decent,’ poor little fellow.”</p>

<p>Mr. Grantly laughed, but said nothing, for
his heart was still young and understanding
of boyish hearts, if his head was white, and
he felt a wise interest in Mrs. Bishop’s
philanthropic scheme.</p>

<p>“Aunty is to pay everything, and she
says she thinks she knows now why all the
hotels up at Abetone were full so she could
not get a good room there for these three
weeks. She finds that she was ‘ordained’
to rescue a boy from his persecutors, as she
persists in calling the circus men. It is
supposed, I believe, that all little boys and
girls of circuses have been stolen from kind
parents, and if not are half-killed with
cruelty by their own.”</p>

<p>“You speak very warmly, young lady,”
Mr. Grantly remarked, a little reproof in his
tone. “There is no doubt that many such
children do suffer and are very unhappy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>

<p>“Those certainly do not!” retorted Betty,
pointing to a number of the circus children
frolicking in the field with Niero and Bianco.
Olga’s red cotton dress was flitting over the
grass, and her merry laugh was echoed by
the other little ones, as Niero finally caught
her red skirts in the chase.</p>

<p>“Of course the clown objected at first,”
Betty continued, “but Aunty was more
determined than he and soon proved to
him that it would be worth his while to
agree. The old lady, whom they call
Nonna, was curiously anxious for Natale
to have a chance at schooling. I wondered
at that till I heard about her son.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” Mr. Grantly assented.
“Some, however, would think he had made
a very fair exchange in giving up the future
of a priest for the easy, out-of-doors life of
an acrobat. There is no accounting for tastes,
though. And is this boy to be made a priest?”</p>

<p>“Only let my Aunty hear you say that!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>laughed the girl. “No, indeed, but the
priest was the only one who would agree to
be troubled with the child, after Miss Lorini
had explained all Aunty’s conditions&mdash;how
Natale was to have a cold bath every morning,
meat to eat every day, and new shoes
as soon as his old ones come into holes.
The priest, too, has agreed to write a letter
to Aunty every month to tell her of Natale’s
progress&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Toward growing into a ‘decent man’?”
interposed Mr. Grantly. “Well, I hope the
plan will work well for all parties. Few
Italian peasant lads get such a chance.”
Then the old gentleman went back to his
chair to continue his nap.</p>

<p>All that afternoon, until four o’clock,
there was an unusual bustle going on about
the little encampment. The tattered,
damp, half-ruined canvas was rolled up and
packed along with poles and planks and
ropes on a small cart hired for this occasion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
while the cooking utensils and the
scant furniture of the tents were gathered
together for conveyance in the house-wagon.
It was a cold and dreary day, following the
night of stormy wind, with the clouds settling
close about the mountain tops and the
wind sweeping down the valley wet with
rain. And in the heart of Natale there
was even less promise of sunshine. He sat
apart from the others on the damp wall,
frowning and sullen.</p>

<p>Half an hour before, he had been almost
forcibly dragged up the hill to the house in
the garden by Giovanni, who had made
little jokes to hide the sulkiness of the boy’s
replies to the questions of the ladies gathered
there. Madame Cioche had promptly hidden
herself when she saw the green gate
open and the pair coming in, but the clown
had walked directly through the hall and up
to the little table where Mrs. Bishop sat
taking her tea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p>No command of Giovanni nor persuasion
of Miss Lorini, who was an artist, could
induce Natale to say: “Thank you, signora,
for your kindness.” His revolt had
been beforehand hushed into silence by
some very plain threats of punishment by
his mother, but nothing could make him
say that he was glad to stay in Cutigliano
and go to school every day.</p>

<p>He stood before them all, miserable as a
child could be, his face very clean and pale,
and a new pair of shoes already upon his
feet. They pinched his toes woefully, but
his heart ached more than his feet.</p>

<p>“You will love the signora very much,
some day, when you are a man and remember
how good she was to the poor little boy
who knew nothing but how to turn somersaults,”
Miss Lorini had said caressingly in
her softest Italian, studying the piteous
face meanwhile with an eye to painting it
some day, when it should smile again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p>“I shall learn to do something besides the
<i>capitomboli</i>,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> when I am a man,” Natale had
said eagerly. “I shall be like our Antonio
some day.” Perhaps these foreigners would
be willing to leave him in peace if he could
convince them that he <i>wished</i> to be a strolling
player all his life.</p>

<p>“He speaks as if he does not exactly
understand,” said Miss Lorini, looking at
Giovanni inquiringly. “Does he not know
that he is to give up the circus now?”</p>

<p>Giovanni shrugged his shoulders, then
shook Natale’s slender shoulder, muttering:</p>

<p>“No more of your silly talk, boy!”
Then louder, “If you will not thank the
lady, I do, with all my heart.” And with
that he bowed low, then pushing Natale
before him, went quickly away. He was,
in secret, rather sorry for the boy, who had
never before given any trouble with foolish
willfulness, and who had moreover such high
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>ambitions! It did seem a stupid life to
which they were leaving the poor child, but
then there was to be considered the roll of
money already sewed into his own belt,
with more to accumulate there, if Natale
should be left still another year with the
priest Luigi. If rich <i>forestieri</i> had nothing
else to do with their money but give it
away in this frantic fashion, the stepfather
was not unwilling to share the bounty, and
Elvira, the mother, had seemed not to mind.</p>

<p>So now Natale sat alone on the wall, feeling
very much out of it all, and longing to
hear some one say, “Natalino, do fetch me
this”, or “Carry that”; but no one said
anything of the kind. They seemed to feel
that he was no longer one of them, and his
little heart swelled to breaking.</p>

<p>He was too young to long harbor ill-will
and of too sunny a spirit to sulk for many
minutes at a time, so presently he slipped
off the wall and ran to meet Olga, who was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>struggling over to the traveling house-on-wheels,
dragging two stools behind her.
The very last things were being done, and
already the horses were standing by, ready
to be hitched at the last moment.</p>

<p>“Do let me carry the stools, Olga,”
Natale pleaded with unwonted entreaty
in his voice. “Well, one of them, then.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry you are going to stay behind
here, Natalino,” the little girl panted.
“Why do you? I should run after the
wagon if I were you!”</p>

<p>Natale had never thought of such a
simple thing to do by way of escape! He
promptly set down the stool he had grasped
and looked fixedly away from Olga’s red-brown
eyes.</p>

<p>Alas! in that critical moment, what did
he see approaching from the village? The
flat, broad-brimmed hat and flowing black
skirts of a priest, descending the street and
turning in at the field!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>There was then not a moment to be lost!
Forgetting Olga and the heavy stools,
Natale turned and fled, away&mdash;anywhere&mdash;out
of sight of the jailor advancing.
Everything flashed out of his mind except
the impulse to escape, to hide himself from
those searching eyes under the felt hat brim.
His flying feet skimmed across the field, and
when they had borne him out of sight down
the nearest slope, Natale flung himself
on the ground under a thicket of thorny
blackberry bushes.</p>

<p>He lay there for what must have been a
long time, for, after a while, a sudden
shower of rain swept down the valley and
for a few minutes enveloped everything
in a gray mist. Even after it had passed,
Natale delayed returning to the wagon
until the priest should have quite gone,
in despair of capturing his prisoner. When
at last he did venture forth, and crept
to the upper verge of the slope, his first
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>glance was across the field for the brown
wagon.</p>

<p>It was not there!</p>

<p>He set out in a headlong run for the place
where it had stood. There was nothing
left&mdash;absolutely nothing. Only a priest
sat quietly waiting in a gap in the wall.</p>

<p>Natale, with eyes only for the deserted
spot, came stumbling upon the man, without
so much as seeing that he was there,
and then the priest rose, and taking the
boy’s hand, spoke with the utmost quietness.</p>

<p>“Come home with me now, Natalino,”
was what he said, and Natale heard as one
hears dream voices.</p>

<p>Poor child! If he had only listened, he
might have heard the dull screeching of the
brakes as the wagon crawled carefully down
the hill toward the arched bridge, and it
would have been an easy matter to snatch
his hand from the limp grasp of the priest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>and go hurrying down the short cuts in
pursuit. But his head seemed so full of
a hundred roaring noises that he could not
hear, and his heart beat so fast that he
could not speak, and so up the hill he went
at the priest’s side.</p>

<p>Nor did he see the quiet smile upon
Luigi’s shaven lips, as they passed the green
gate of the garden where Betty stood peering
through. She would not have spoken to the
boy just then for all the world, and as for
Madame Cioche, she could not have done
so if she had wished. She gazed down from
her latticed window, her bright eyes dimmed
as they fell upon the little caged bird of the
fields fluttering by.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE CAGED BIRD OF THE FIELDS</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>here</span> is a short, crooked street in
Cutigliano, which leads back of the
church and out upon the promenade
of San Vito. This street is confined on
either hand by stone houses and stone walls
of gardens, and paved with large square
stones. Here and there a gateway gives a
peep at lapping hills across the river. The
massive church tower rises directly from a
narrow turn in this street, and when the
bells ring down from the arches in the top
of this tower, the stony street reverberates
with a deafening clamor.</p>

<p>By the time the priest and Natale reached
the foot of the church tower, the boy was
weeping bitterly but quietly. His one free
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>arm hid as much of his face as possible,
and his feet in the clumsy new shoes stumbled
so helplessly that Luigi had some
trouble in preventing his falling.</p>

<p>As they had passed through the town,
where everybody sat at their doors or
lounged in the <i>piazza</i>, all had recognized
the little acrobat, as Natale realized only
too well. Many accosted him in wonder,
and some would even have stopped him to
inquire into his misfortune in being left
behind by his family. But the young
priest motioned such away with authority,
silencing with a gesture of his long finger the
too curious. Others had already learned
how it had come about that Natale was to
spend a year with Sora Grazia, and her son
the priest, and these contented themselves
with shrugs and smiles for the boy’s companion,
as who should say: “We wish you
well of your bargain, Signor priest.”</p>

<p>The great hands of the church clock
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>pointed to ten minutes of four, as the bell
boomed the hour of six. No one, however,
ever thought of consulting the huge figures
painted on the stone face of the tower
clock, for those long iron hands had not
stirred for many a day.</p>

<p>The deep sound of the bell struck so
suddenly upon Natale’s ears that he started,
and dropping his arm from before his eyes,
gazed dully ahead. It was not often that
he had strayed farther than this corner of the
old church, and he had never followed the
San Vito promenade to the end. Most of
the town was left behind now; whither
could this man be taking him?</p>

<p>A row of houses with numbers in blue
figures on one side of the lintels extended
back of the church, but before none of
these did Luigi pause. Next came a low,
broken wall, and then a house, detached
from its neighbors and with a long, sloping
roof, covered with slabs of slate. This
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>house had no door opening on the street,
and in the blank front wall there was only
a very small window at one corner close
under the eaves. Over a door in the end of
the house nearest the church there was a
small crucifix in carved stone set into the
wall, but this door was seemingly closed
and unused.</p>

<p>The priest led Natale a few steps farther,
to the other end of the house, and then they
left the street and entered a long balcony
leading to a wide-open door.</p>

<p class="p2b">A middle-aged woman sat just inside this
doorway at the foot of a flight of stairs
leading up into the room under the roof.
She wore a kerchief of red and black cotton
over her head and tied in a knot under her
chin, and her eyes were bent upon a coarse
piece of mending occupying her work-worn
hands.</p>

<p class="caption">The priest led Natale to the other end of the house.<br />
<span class="center"><i>Page <a href="#Page_94">94.</a></i></span></p>

<p class="p2">At Luigi’s heavy step on the stone flooring
of the balcony, she lifted her face to his and
something like a smile softened the expression
of her stern features. Her black brows
unbent and she made way for her son to
enter by twisting her stool slightly and
shifting her feet. Luigi passed by her and
took up his stand in the gathering gloom of
the little passage, his eyes fixed warily upon
Natale. The little boy had released his
hand from the priest’s outside the door,
and now stood leaning against the railing
of the balcony, staring frowningly at the
woman.</p>

<p>“You are content to have it over with,
Gigi?” the mother asked, glancing from
man to boy and back again.</p>

<p>Luigi nodded his head.</p>

<p>“Give him something to eat and put him
to bed,” he counseled in a low tone, “and
do not argue with him to-night. To-morrow
the sun will shine and he will begin
to forget.”</p>

<p>Natale’s sharp ears caught every word,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>stolid as he looked. “Forget?” What did
they think he would forget? Not Olga’s
last words, certainly: “I would run after
the wagon, if I were you.”</p>

<p>But, <i>why was he not running now</i>? No
door, as yet, kept him prisoner. There was
the empty street. Below ran the long,
long white road. The night was coming
down, and he was not afraid of the dark.
Once out of sight, around one of the loops
of the road, it would take but a moment to
slip off the heavy shoes with their soles half
an inch thick, and then on and on in the
cool darkness he might run on light bare
feet&mdash;“after the wagon.”</p>

<p>He thrilled with the thought as it flashed
through his mind, but a flash of the same
thought thrilled Sora Grazia at the same
time, for just then she leaned forward and
laying her hand on Natale’s arm, she drew
him to her side.</p>

<p>“Once I had a curly-haired little boy of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>my own,” she said with a serious smile,
“but after a while, he grew to be a man, and
now he has brought to me another little
boy. Natalino, I hope you will be as good
a boy as my Gigi ever was.”</p>

<p>Natale gazed earnestly into the woman’s
face.</p>

<p>“I am not at all good, signora,” he said
unsteadily, and he could not help the stirring
of hope in his heart, with this confession,
but Sora Grazia only smiled again and
tapped his cheek, and said that perhaps the
good Luigi would teach him to be good.</p>

<p>And there was no more opportunity left
Natale for running away, for he was presently
led into the kitchen where he had to
sit and watch Sora Grazia prepare the
macaroni for supper. He was hungry
enough to enjoy a plateful of this but the
slip of boiled beef served him on a clean
plate afterward could not be choked down.
He had overheard some one in the tent&mdash;could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
it have been only that very day?&mdash;say
that he was to have meat every day in
his new home, and his sister, Arduina, had
added that she wished <i>she</i> were sure of
getting a morsel three times a week. Had
not a doctor in Sicily said that she must
have all delicate and nourishing food? And
what were dry bread and sour wine as substitutes?
No, Natale could not eat the
meat that night. Happily the plate of
macaroni had been generous, and what in
all the land of sunny Italy is so filling as a
plate of macaroni?</p>

<p>The valley looked dismally dark that
night, as Natale crept from his little trestle
bed and crouched on the brick floor at the
window, after he was supposed to be asleep.
He was to share the priest’s attic chamber,
and a few moments before Sora Grazia had
carried away the candle. He peered out
between the flower pots on the window
ledge and again wondered in his childish
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>way why anybody in the big world outside
should have troubled to make him miserable.</p>

<p>He was very sure that he had done
nothing to harm the foreign lady with the
spectacles. Once he had laughed when
she had sneezed many times very loudly,
in crossing the field near him, but he was
sure no one had heard him, for he was lying
on the ground and had buried his face in the
grass. The pretty signorina with her had
laughed too, and said something in their
strange language which the lady had answered
by another loud sneeze. Besides this,
there was absolutely nothing he could have
done to provoke any of the people in the
garden. Yet, here he was being punished!</p>

<p>The thought of Sora Grazia oppressed
him, her serious face and her high hopes of
his goodness. The house, too, was quieter
than any place he had ever known,&mdash;he
who had been used to few roofs save those
of the caravan and tent. There were no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>children about, and there was no sound
inside of crying, or laughing, or singing, or
whistling. It was almost as bad as having
to live in a solemn church when the candles
are all out and the crowds are gone, and
one feels, in the dimness and silence, as if
something were coming up stealthily behind
one to scare one’s wits away. It is all very
well to rest for a minute in a cool church,
out of the glare of the sunlight, when one
may run out again at will, free as a wild bird
or butterfly. But to have to stay, night
and day, for a whole year in such a place!
Natale shuddered, for this was just the way
in which the awful quiet of the little stone
house of the priest affected him.</p>

<p>When Luigi came up to bed, hours later,
he lifted the sleeping boy from the bricks
at the window and covered him up snugly
in bed.</p>

<p>“My mother thinks we can do it,” he
muttered to himself, as he threw off his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>black gown. “I shall do my part, but I am
not sure they have done a wise thing.”
Then he sighed a little. Perhaps he was
wishing that he could be a little boy again,
with the wide, wide world before him, and
no one to interfere with his choice of a career,&mdash;free
to be acrobat or priest, but always
to have his own choice.</p>

<p>With the passing of the first night all idea
of running away seemed to have left Natale’s
mind, and Sora Grazia was at first delighted
to find her charge as submissive as
a lamb to all her arrangements. After the
first day or two, however, it became not
quite so comfortable to see the little boy
sit immovable for hours at a time, on the
floor of the balcony, gazing down into the
valley where the river ran merrily over the
rocks. She would even have preferred to
rebuke the child for something a little more
outrageous than his listless torpor. She
herself had to eat the meat prepared for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>Natale, if she would not see it wasted, for
Natale could not touch it, nor would Luigi,
her usually tractable son.</p>

<p>The young priest was no less puzzled over
Natale’s conduct than his mother was.
The schoolmaster reported to him that the
boy held his little paper-covered spelling-book
before his eyes with the utmost diligence,
and really seemed to try to remember
the letters as they were pointed out to him
with patient repetition, but that he might
as well have been gazing off into the valley
instead, for all the good the pages did him,
and Luigi believed it.</p>

<p>The other boys tried to lure him into their
games and to practice his funny <i>capitomboli</i>
but he would only sit quietly by, on the
stone steps of the church, watching them
till playtime was over, when he must sit up
on the bench in the schoolroom again and
hold his book before his eyes.</p>

<p>“He cannot keep up his sulking forever,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>Sora Grazia said on the sixth day of Natale’s
stay with her. Luigi was standing near her
in the balcony, brushing the dust from the
skirts of his long gown, which he shook
vigorously with his strong hands, as his
mother continued, “I confess that I am
surprised he has taken things so quietly.”</p>

<p>“A little too quietly!” muttered Luigi
into the folds of his gown.</p>

<p>“But now, one would like to see him
brighten up a little instead of glooming
over his food and everything else,” Sora
Grazia went on. “He is not the same child
he was a week ago, making his ridiculous
<i>capitomboli</i> over the circus carpet. I wonder
if he could turn a somersault now,
Luigi.” The woman lifted her head from
her work to look over at Natale, who sat
on the low street wall with his feet dangling
into the road.</p>

<p>“I gave him leave to go and play with
the boys down in the field, this afternoon,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>said Luigi, shaking his gown almost
viciously. “He said he did not wish to go
where his tent had been, and that he never
expected to turn a somersault again.”</p>

<p>“Impertinent!” exclaimed Sora Grazia.
“We’ll let him alone a while longer, and
he’ll come all right. A child cannot sulk
forever, as I said before.”</p>

<p>“But one can die of starvation and homesickness,
perhaps,” quoth Luigi, stepping
past his mother and springing up the stairs,
his gown upon his arm.</p>

<p>Grazia’s retort was stayed upon her lips
by what she now saw passing in the street.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE CAGE DOOR OPENED</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">N</span>atale</span>, too, was looking up, but
only dully, as a party of ladies and
gentlemen sauntered toward him
laughing and talking gayly as they came.
Many such groups had passed him already,
taking afternoon strolls toward the beautiful
promenade of San Vito leading around the
mountain side. But this particular group
paused, when a spectacled old lady did, and
all gathered about Natale, except the white-haired
gentleman standing a little aloof
and tapping the paving stones with his
stick.</p>

<p>“Why haven’t you been to see us, Natale
Marzuchetti?” Miss Lorini asked cheerfully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
in Italian. “Mrs. Bishop was sure
you would come.”</p>

<p>“He does not look like the same child!”
whispered Betty to her aunt, who now
pushed forward.</p>

<p>“Ask him if he is a <i>smart</i> boy in school,
and if he is not <i>glad</i> to be dressed so decently
and to be learning something <i>useful</i>,”
Mrs. Bishop said hurriedly to the
Italian lady, all of which was repeated to
Natale in his own language as was requested.
But Natale only shook his head
slowly and wistfully.</p>

<p>“You used to talk fast enough!” Mrs.
Bishop cried impatiently. “Look,” she
went on, pointing to the next house, a little
farther on, “don’t you see that white stone
in the wall? The words on it tell about a
man who was born there, two hundred and
fifty years ago, who was so good and useful
that the people here put his name up there
that he might never be forgotten. What’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>to hinder there being a stone put up on this
house, to tell about little Natale who was
only a poor circus boy, but who came to
live here when he was eight years old and
became a very useful and good man? Tell
him, Miss Lorini, just what I say!” And
Mrs. Bishop pointed from the memorial
tablet in one house to the blank front wall
of the other, while Luigi, peering out of his
window between the flower pots, dodged
behind a tall geranium, and hoped the sharp
eyes of the old lady were not searching for
him.</p>

<p>Natale listened gravely to Miss Lorini’s
communication, his eyes passing carelessly
from the memorial tablet to the wall of an
opposite house.</p>

<p>There was a rude painting on this wall of
a Madonna holding a baby in her arms, and
it was protected from the weather by a
shallow arch of masonry. As Natale looked
at the picture, he was reminded in some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>mysterious way of Nonna, who was never
without a child in her arms, unless she were
bending over a fountain washing the children’s
clothes. A new look sprang into
his eyes.</p>

<p>“Our Antonio had <i>his</i> name printed in
Egypt and in Turkey and in Greece!” he
answered proudly, for the first time opening
his lips. “I would rather be like that than
have my name cut here on the priest’s
house!”</p>

<p>“Good for the little chap,” cried the
gentleman softly. He had understood what
the shrill little voice said.</p>

<p>“Printed on what, child? What was
‘our Antonio’s’ name printed on, in all
those places?” Miss Lorini asked.</p>

<p>“On paper, of course,” answered the child
simply. “And there were pictures of him
too, all red and yellow and blue, performing
on the bars. Everybody in the streets
was looking at his name and the pictures.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>The little fellow’s face was glowing as he
spoke of his friend, and Miss Lorini had not
the heart to translate his words to Mrs.
Bishop, who could hardly have passed them
by calmly.</p>

<p>“But you are content here?” Betty
managed to ask in intelligible Italian.</p>

<p>The shadow fell again over Natale’s face,
and his figure visibly drooped. He did
not pretend to answer her question.</p>

<p>“Oh, Aunty, let him go back to his
people,” Betty pleaded, seeing the change.
“Anybody can see that he is miserable.
He is too little to be made to suffer.”</p>

<p>“He is too little to suffer long,” Mrs.
Bishop replied calmly, with but one thought
in her mind, of course.</p>

<p>“Poor little Egyptian!” sighed the gentleman.
“He was born in Egypt, was he not,
Miss Betty?”</p>

<p>“At Port Said, yes, and Pietro in Tunis
they say.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>
<p>“Well, be a good boy, Natale,” said Mrs.
Bishop, patting his head, in its new cap.
“Then you will be happy. In a few days,
I shall send for you to come to see me, and
we will drink tea in the garden. Good-by!
<i>Addio!</i>”</p>

<p>Natale touched his hat, as he had long
ago been taught to do, and the pedestrians
moved away, all but the gentleman who
had called him a “little Egyptian.”</p>

<p>He stood for a moment at Natale’s side,
with his back turned to the house and his
departing friends, and in a trice a handful
of copper coins was transferred from his
pocket to Natale’s hands. Mr. Grantly
had just had a paper note changed into small
coins, at the fruit shop, and he was glad to
relieve his pocket of some of its weight.</p>

<p>“I hope his guardians will let him keep
the money,” was his thought as he turned
away from Natale’s brilliant smile of thanks.
The boy’s training had made him none too
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>proud to accept the money of a stranger,
and he lost no time in stowing it away in
his jacket pocket, while Mr. Grantly hurried
after the echoing steps of his party.</p>

<p>Luigi at the window above had seen the
money given to Natale, but he asked no
questions of the boy, who, after kicking his
heels against the wall for some time longer,
was presently called to his supper.</p>

<p>There was a flush on Natale’s cheeks and
a brightness in his eyes which even Sora
Grazia noticed, and as the evening was cool,
she thought it wise to forbid his sitting
out on the balcony or the wall, as was his
wont, until bedtime. He looked feverish,
she said, and in her own mind she planned
a cup of hot camomile tea as a remedy at
bedtime. Natale’s disappointment at this
command to keep indoors showed so plainly
upon his childish features that Sora Grazia
was provoked, and for the first time since the
boy had been with her she used harsh tones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>

<p>“There! you may as well go to bed at
once!” she cried, as he was leaving the
kitchen, without a word it is true, but with
the light all gone from his face. “I can
never please you, whatever I do, and you
are here only to waste food and sulk. Go
to bed, Natale!”</p>

<p>Luigi had gone off directly after eating his
supper, about some matter of business with
one of his superiors at the church, so he was
not there to take Natale’s part.</p>

<p>It is hard enough to be sent to bed on an
ordinary night and at one’s regular time, as
any child will agree, but to be forbidden the
early hours of a moonlit evening outdoors,
especially when one’s little head is teeming
with wild, delicious ideas of flight&mdash;away
from daily baths, from the cramping walls
of a house, and out into the freshness and
freedom of the night, which has no terror
for the dwellers in tents, was well-nigh
unbearable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span></p>

<p>Ah! how little Sora Grazia knew of the
anguish she was causing!</p>

<p>But Natale obediently stumbled slowly
upstairs in the dark to the bedroom, and
when there, crouched in his usual place on
the floor behind the flower pots without an
audible murmur.</p>

<p>The little acrobat had made no plans at
all, but with the touch of the money given
him by the kind old gentleman on San Vito,
an impulse to seek his freedom had occurred
to his mind, and in the half-hour while he
continued on the wall, furtively handling
the coins in his pocket, he had wished,&mdash;only
wished, however,&mdash;that he might
have the courage to steal out into the moonlight,
after eating, while Sora Grazia should
be about her dish-washing, and Luigi poring
over one of his little black books, perhaps, by
the light of the candle in the kitchen. He
had often thought of Olga’s words, “I would
run after the wagon, if I were you,” but he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>had been too closely watched during the
first day or two to admit of his carrying out
so bold a plan, and since then, for the rest of
the long, dreary week since the caravan had
gone, he had not had the spirit to undertake
such a measure. The whole world seemed
to intervene between himself and the beloved
company who had gone, and he felt
sure that he would be seen by some mistaken
person and brought back, even before he
could reach the river, if he should attempt
to follow.</p>

<p>Until to-night no thought of leaving under
the protection of the friendly darkness had
come to him, and he had only been able to
see himself flying down the sunny road in
full view of all the village, to be promptly
turned back again by some carriage driver
of the place, or some schoolboy bigger than
himself and therefore stronger. Besides,
he had had no money, and Natale had
traveled enough to know that a few cents
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>in one’s pocket make one’s road easier and
less long. So the days had passed, and
Natale was fast drifting into a state of listless
torpor which must have ended in illness,
had not Mr. Grantly changed a five-franc
note at the fruit shop that sunny afternoon
and taken a stroll along San Vito where
Natale sat “sulking” on the wall!</p>

<p>Presently, as the little child continued to
gaze longingly out into the moonlight, a ray
of further hope illumined his mind. As
Luigi had gone to the church now, it would
be late before he would return. Sora
Grazia always sat dozing on her stool in the
doorway until time for barring the door and
going to bed. Why should he not slip past
her and away into the shadows of the street,
before Luigi should return? His heart
leaped at the thought, and he rose noiselessly
to his feet and glanced around the
darkening room. His small cot stood
smooth and white against the wall. Another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
thought struck him, and he quailed
with a sense of utter discouragement.
When Luigi should come in,&mdash;and he
might be very early, one never knew,&mdash;the
runaway would be missed straightway from
the empty little bed, and easily overtaken
if he should have taken the regular road
down the hill.</p>

<p>It is true there were paths innumerable
down the terraces from the back of almost
any house in the street, most of them
probably leading down to the river far
below, but Natale had been no explorer of
the neighborhood during his week of captivity,
and was ignorant of the precipitate
windings and the final ending of even the
most practicable of these. No, he must go
by the road, and he must wait until Luigi
should return, and get to bed and to sleep.</p>

<p>Natale knew that the priest slept soundly,
for, one night he had had the misfortune to
knock over upon the floor a pot containing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>a carnation plant, and the crash had not
awakened Luigi. The boy had waked and
had gone to the window to peer out into the
night, fancying that he heard the hoarse
creaking of the caravan brake as the clumsy
vehicle crawled down the hill, and in craning
his head between the pots, his elbow had
pushed over one of them. Fortunately,
neither pot nor plant had broken, and he
had spent a good deal of time in packing the
loosened earth about the carnation’s roots
and replacing the pot among its fellows.
The next morning, Sora Grazia had bidden
him be more careful about carrying mud
upstairs on his shoes, only to be cleaned up
by her afterward, and he supposed he must
have left some of the earth upon the floor,
in the dim light.</p>

<p>At any rate, Luigi slept soundly, and if
he, himself, could only manage to keep
awake until all was safe, he knew that he
would have no difficulty in unbarring the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>door. He had accomplished it unaided
only that morning, with Sora Grazia standing
by and saying that it was the first thing
of use he had set his hands to do since coming
there to live. She had spoken good-naturedly
though, and Natale had nothing
against her. No, not even now did he
remember her late harsh words, for he was
too sweet-natured to harbor malice. He had
only suffered, and now there was a prospect
of escaping more suffering of the same kind.</p>

<p>So after sitting on his bed with a wild
turmoil of thoughts engaging his busy little
brain, he began rapidly to undress. Luigi
must not find him up! But, after taking
off the strong new suit of clothes which
Mrs. Bishop had had made for him, he
rummaged under his mattress where his
old things had been stored by Sora Grazia
and quickly got into the worn trousers, the
faded blouse and leggings, tucking the old
shoes under his pillow. He had set the new
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>shoes and stockings in orderly fashion on the
floor and folded up the new clothes and laid
them at the foot of the little cot. How
fortunate that his old shoes had not been
thrown away, for he could hardly have
traveled barefoot over the flinty stones of
the road and the river. Natale chose to
wear the old easy shoes, for the new ones
had always hurt him, and he would not have
been able to steal unheard out of the house
with those heavy, creaking soles tramping
over the bricks. If he had known of the
long way ahead of the old worn shoes, perhaps
he would have planned to carry the
despised footgear in his hands. But forethought
had little place in the mind of so
young a runaway, and he was guided in his
change of clothes only by his own desires for
comfort. The old clothes were as familiar as
old friends, and therefore he preferred them.</p>

<p>Then, after making his preparations, not
forgetting to change the money from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>pocket of the new jacket to that of his old
trousers, he laid himself down on the cot,
and drew up the light covering snugly about
his shoulders, devoutly hoping that he
would not fall soundly asleep.</p>

<p>If Natale had only known it, Sora Grazia,
believing Natale safe for the night, had
slipped off for a gossip with a friend living
just back of the church, simply drawing the
door to behind her and leaving the coast
clear for flight. And it would not have been
difficult for the boy to leave a semblance of
himself tucked under the bed covering, in
the shape of the roll of discarded clothes and
shoes! But little Natale was not possessed
of a very designing brain, and after all, Luigi
<i>might</i> have come in untimely, and spoiled
it all!</p>

<p>In a few moments, the would-be runaway
was fast asleep, while the moon sailed across
the valley from the eastern toward the
western sky.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen</span> Natale next opened his

awake indeed, in an instant.
In fact, he did not know that he had been

in, showed Luigi’s long body stretched upon
the iron bed close by.</p>

<p>What could have waked Natale? For a
moment he lay still without recollection of
the momentous plans made at his early bedtime.
Then he recalled a sensation of icy
cold water about his feet, and he remembered
that he had dreamed of a sudden
plunge into the river while trying to find the
stepping-stones. It must have been the
chill of the dream-water that had awakened
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>him! He sat up and found that he was
still dressed and in his old clothes.</p>

<p>Ah! it was easy to remember all now,
and after a breathless glance over his
shoulder at Luigi, who was comfortably
snoring, Natale slipped out of bed. Catching
up his old hat and his shoes he stole
softly over the brick floor and down the
stone stairs as quietly as any mouse would
have done.</p>

<p>Sora Grazia slept downstairs, but the
door of her room was mercifully closed, and
Natale knew that she often locked it at
night. He turned his back upon it, therefore,
with confidence, as he felt in the darkness
for the balcony door. He exerted all
his strength to raise the heavy bar of iron
which guarded the door. Then he was very
careful to keep his hold on the bar, as it
swung downward, lest it should rouse the
house with its usual clanging fall. The huge
key was in the lock, and Natale succeeded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>in turning it with both hands, although this
was much more difficult than raising the bar
above the lock. It creaked dully as it
turned, and Natale’s heart leaped into his
throat, and a dozen noises buzzed in his
ears.</p>

<p>Breathless, he stood with his hand on the
latch, afraid to move lest the door behind
him should open, and everything come to an
end. But nothing happened, so he swung
open the door, and without stopping to
close it behind him, he again caught up his
shoes, which he had had to set down, and
ran along the balcony and out into the
street, his feet pattering softly on the
stones.</p>

<p>In his haste he did not stop to think of the
direction he should take. His only impulse
was to get out into the night somewhere,
away from the houses and street.
So he ran swiftly along in the shadow cast
by wall and house, in just the opposite
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>direction from that which would have led
him past the church tower and through the
village, out upon the downward road.
Presently he crouched in a shadow to draw
on his shoes, then fled onward again.</p>

<p>Once away, he lost his bearings utterly and
hurried on without turning, past the small
house with the Madonna painted on the
wall, past the large house where the white
tablet to “Pietro Pacioni” gleamed in the
moonlight, and then downward, by a
roughly paved path leading to the Campo
Santo. Perhaps he would have kept on
aimlessly along San Vito,&mdash;the fashionable
promenade leading always higher along the
mountain side till it ended in an open
plateau high up above the valley,&mdash;if he
had not heard steps approaching. Whether
these steps came from behind or from ahead
he did not stop to discover. The downward
path offered safety, and a small pink villa
threw a dark shadow across its entrance, so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>Natale lost not an instant in scudding down
the friendly by-way.</p>

<p>On he trotted, past the shrine where the
tiny Della Robbia Madonna sits under her
arch, the moonlight touching the shining
blue of her hood, the yellow of her robe and
the pink of the baby on her knees with a
radiance that was almost startling on the
edge of the shadow. Now the path grew
level, and the stones were left behind, and
no more noise of footsteps disturbed the
quiet.</p>

<p>A few rods more, and Natale stood in
front of the small mortuary chapel outside
the cemetery. The iron gates set in the
wall of the cemetery were locked, as Natale
found on gently shaking them. He had
paused to peep through the slender grating
into the inclosure where the moonlight
touched the white tomb of the foreign
gentleman buried close under the wall, and
showed so plainly the numbers on the low
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>stakes marking the graves of the nameless
poor. The shadows of the cypress trees lay
like long black fingers outstretched upon the
wilds of weedy undergrowth, and the wind
stirred dismally on the exposed hillside.</p>

<p>One day, Natale and Olga had wandered
together as far as these iron gates. He
remembered it now, and with the recollection
he sprang away, eager to continue his
journey,&mdash;then stood still, uncertain as to
his path.</p>

<p>The way which had brought him downward
came to an abrupt end with the little
chapel, outside the gates. It would not do
to lose himself among the chestnut woods in
search of a path! Yet, how could he plunge
down the pathless slopes among the great
trees, with nothing to guide him but the
murmur of the river far below? Still less
was he willing to return to the road above
and turn about to take his way through the
village and so on out upon the road. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>was almost sure that if he could only see to
find his way, some downward path from
where he stood would bring him to a river
crossing, perhaps a long, long way below the
arched bridge, and therefore much farther
on his journey.</p>

<p>Bewildered and tired, he was almost
ready to give up his flight, and to creep into
the dark portico of the little chapel, and
back into the shade beneath the picture of
the Saint with the skull in his hand, and
there end this strange night, which already
seemed to him longer than any night he had
ever known. But he roused himself to one
more effort, and crept around to the back
wall of the chapel. There, to his joyful
surprise, he came upon a semblance of a
path!</p>

<p>All indecision was gone now, and he fairly
slid down the rocky and precipitous way,
which was more gully than footway, being
in fact a watercourse for the torrents leaping
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>down the mountain side, after some storm
of rain, as well as a short cut to the river for
roughly shod peasant feet.</p>

<p>More than once Natale stumbled, and
once he fell headlong, bruising his hands and
knees, but he did not mind, for the rushing
of the little river down among the rocks was
becoming very loud in his ears.</p>

<p>When at last he came out of the woods,
and stood on the edge of the waste of
rounded stones loosely paving the river bed,
he looked back a moment to where the
village must be, high above, a huddle of gray
wall and roof, with the square church tower
in its midst. All seemed as silent in the
sleeping town as in the home of the sleeping
dead on its outskirts. Then, just as Natale
again turned his back upon the mountain
side, where perched Cutigliano like a bit of
gray lichen growing on some mossy bowlder,
the beautiful, bright, friendly moon slipped
quite over the mountain in the west, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>darkness fell upon the valley, where deep
down in its darkest shadow Natale was
ready to cross the river. The light of the
moon still touched the chestnut woods
higher up the slopes, but every moment the
shadow would be creeping higher and
higher, until there would be no more moonlight
on this side the mountain, and only the
stars would come peeping out at Natale.</p>

<p>After slipping off his shoes and leggings,
the boy began picking his way carefully over
the large dry stones which were worn
smooth and round by slow wasting in the
wet seasons, when the river flooded its
narrow course and spread to the grassy
banks. The stones rolled under even his
light footsteps, but Natale kept his balance
in crossing the smaller stones, and clambered
patiently over or around the largest ones,
and presently arrived at the edge of the
black, rushing water. The brawling Lima
makes a great ado hereabouts, as it tumbles
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>over the rocks, for its bed slopes decidedly
all the way to Lucca and beyond, and there
is no opportunity for it to moderate its
pace, or calm its chafings against the rocks.</p>

<p>With the first touch of the icy water upon
his bared feet, Natale recalled his dream.
How long ago it had been since he had lain
safely in his bed under the slanting roof of
Luigi’s house! Again and again he tried
to plant his foot firmly in the midst of the
swirling water, which was perhaps as much
as twenty feet wide at that point, but
always it was deeper and colder than he had
expected, and the stones more slippery and
unsteady. Then he began wandering up and
down the bank, in quest of the stepping-stones,
which here and there certainly
crossed the river both above and below the
arched bridge. Unsuccessful in this, Natale
finally exerted himself to make a reckless
dash into the current, where he found himself
the next instant up to his waist in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>black water and clinging desperately by
one free hand to a wet rock, with the instinct
of preserving himself from being
carried off his feet. Then miserably he felt
his way back to the dry rocks on the edge
of the stream, and dropping down upon
their harsh bosom, he began to cry bitterly.</p>

<p>He had so hoped there would be a crossing
place! If he could only find it! His
feet were sore with bruises now, and he felt
as if he could not walk another step. He
grew cold as he crouched there, sobbing with
disappointment, for though the sun shines
hot during the daytime on the chestnut
trees and the vines of the Apennines, the
nights, even of summer, are cool, and now
a chill wind came sweeping down the valley
from the fir-crowned summits of Abetone.</p>

<p>Presently the little wanderer roused himself
and stood on his feet. Nothing could
tempt him to try to find his way back to the
house of the priest, not even aching feet or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>shivering limbs, but he began to think there
might be a more sheltered place near by&mdash;this
little boy of the road, who had taken
many a noontide nap curled up at the foot of
some wayside tree. Perhaps the earliest light
of dawn would show him the stepping-stones
and the road, of which there was no hint
now in the blackness of darkness across the
river. Painfully he crept back toward the
bank, where presently he curled himself into
a knot at the foot of a huge, distorted old
chestnut tree, a short distance up the slope.
The grass was soft and springy about the
roots of the old tree, and a huge boulder near
by shut off the wind from Natale’s shivering
legs. So, with a sigh of content, and for
the first time tasting the sweets of his new
freedom, the little acrobat closed his eyes
upon the stars winking down at him from
above the stirring leaves, and fell asleep for
the second time that night.</p>

<span class="no-indent">ON THE WING</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">L</span>ong</span> before Natale waked, the day had
dawned, but the sun had not long
looked down into the valley before
he turned stiffly on his grassy couch and
rubbed his eyes. Then, however, he lost not
an instant in taking up his journey where it
had left off the night before.</p>

<p>How easy it was in the light of the sunbeams
of the early morning to spring over
the dry stones of the bank, and with a swift
glance up and down select a safe place to
cross the water which had seemed so dangerous
and cruel in the dark.</p>

<p>The daylight changed everything, of
course, and it was but a few moments after
waking before he was across the stream and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>scrambling up to the low wall bounding the
road on the river side. From the inner
edge of the road the mountains rose precipitately.</p>

<p>As Natale clambered over the wall the
church bells of Cutigliano burst into a
wrangle of sound, which must have echoed
from one end of the village to the other.
Though the distance softened the metallic
tones, the little boy was startled by them
into a scamper away down the sunlit road
as if the mischievous village boys whose
office it was to ring the bells were in headlong
chase after him. The day must have
been the <i>festa</i> of some saint, and for a long
time Natale heard the bells’ voices, sweetened
more and more as his bare feet trudged
onward and the distance fell between him
and them. But he soon gave up his running
because his legs were stiff and his feet sore,
and as yet no one appeared coming along
the road behind him, in pursuit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>There had been no doubt in his own mind
of the direction he should take after once
gaining the road. He knew that Giovanni
and Antonio with the house-wagon had been
bound for the Bagni di Lucca, and also he
knew that the road to the Bagni led downward
with the stream, and not up toward
the cold region of Abetone, the “Great Fir
Tree.”</p>

<p>So all he had to do was to follow the road,
broad and white, by the way they had come
three weeks before, without need, even, of
asking his way of the peasants he should
meet. He had turned the shoulder of a great
green mountain-spur which entirely shut
off the view of Cutigliano before he would
stop for an instant in his lame tramping.
Once assured that the town was out of sight
behind him, he sat down breathlessly on
one of the heaps of loose stones such as flank
every mountain road in Italy. Then he
deliberately took each foot in turn in his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>small hands and gravely and pitifully
examined its bruises. There was nothing
to be done, then, but plant them in the road
again and continue his way.</p>

<p>For an hour or more he trudged painfully
on, but the stiffness in his legs left him after
a while, and he began to be only hungry.
He wished he had thought of hiding in his
pocket, the night before, a crust of the dark,
coarse bread he loved, and which had always
been plentiful at Sora Grazia’s. But
the coppers jingled comfortably there instead,
and Natale contented himself to
wait for breakfast till he should pass some
bread shop along the road.</p>

<p>The morning air was sweet with the freshness
of early day, and the delicious odor of
the wild thyme’s tiny blossoms. Tall harebells
nodded to him from the thyme and
heather bank shoulder-high above the road,
and sparkled with the sunshine and dew
upon their purple flowerets. The river,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>which in the darkness had seemed to mock
him with its roaring, now only murmured
softly as it slipped over the stones in the
sunlight.</p>

<p>By and by, Natale began to meet people
in the road, men with donkeys bearing huge
basketfuls of wet grass and wild flowers
shorn from the steep terraces above for the
cow or donkey at home, and women tramping
in their thick-soled shoes to Cutigliano
with baskets of fresh fruit or eggs or cheeses
for the summer hotels balanced on their
heads. From all of these Natale kept his face
steadily averted, lest they should bear back
to the town tidings of his going. Usually,
after passing a group of these wayfarers, the
boy broke into a quick run in order to
lengthen the distance between them and
himself, but these spurts of speed availed
him little, for he had always to stop and rest
afterward, and so lost many more minutes
than he had gained of the golden day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span></p>

<p>The road had already become a curving
white glare before Natale came in sight of a
long stone house having many windows and
doors, and standing on the inner edge of the
road. He came upon it suddenly, on turning
a sharp curve, and then he saw that
another house faced it on the opposite side
of the road, and that an inviting shade lay
between. The back of one of the houses
looked directly upon the steep slope of the
mountain behind, while the rear wall of its
opposite neighbor had its foundation in the
rocky banks of the tumbling river. In the
shade between, barefoot peasant children
played noisily. Near by, a stream of spring
water, clear and cold, trickled from a
wooden trough into a rough stone basin.</p>

<p>And here at last were rest and food and
drink for the runaway,&mdash;only no one must
learn that he was a runaway!</p>

<p>A fat and black-eyed housewife with arms
akimbo stood in one of the doors, and as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>Natale came up to her on limping feet, she
eyed him with interest from the stone of the
doorstep.</p>

<p>“Will you give me a little piece of bread,
signora? See, I have money,” said Natale,
showing her a handful of Mr. Grantly’s
copper coins in his open palm.</p>

<p>“A bit of bread you shall have, to be sure,
and your <i>soldi</i> you shall keep, little one,”
the good-natured creature promptly answered,
and while the children left their
play and gathered about Natale, with
friendly eyes, their mother disappeared into
the very small and dusky shop behind.</p>

<p>“There, sit down and eat,” she said,
returning with a hunk of bread and a
generous lump of cheese on a coarse plate
in her hand.</p>

<p>As Natale received the plate and moved
rather lamely toward the dripping fountain
in the shade, the children ran ahead, and
one filled a rusty tin cup with the cold
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>water and had it ready for Natale by the
time he reached the mossy brink of the
fountain.</p>

<p>These little ones of the road, wild and rude
enough in their play, were well used to offering
the “cup of cold water” to the passing
wayfarer, and Natale’s thirsty throat gulped
the draught gratefully.</p>

<p>There was something about the child
which arrested the attention of the woman
more than the ordinary passer-by often did,
and she also stood watching Natale breakfast
hungrily.</p>

<p>He was shy and downcast, fearing difficult
questions, and as soon as the last
crumb of bread and cheese had disappeared
he got to his feet, setting the empty plate
on the margin of the fountain.</p>

<p>“Thank you, signora, and good-by,” he
said, and was off.</p>

<p>“No, but wait!” she cried, laying her
hand on his shrinking shoulder. “You
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>have eaten my bread; now answer my
questions. What is your name, <i>picino</i>,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
and where are you going?”</p>

<p>“Down the road,” was the shyly spoken
answer to the last question, with a quiet
waiving of the first. “Please let me go,
signora. It is already late, and I must
hasten.”</p>

<p>“Well, go!” she exclaimed then, “and a
good journey to you!” But she stood
watching him trudge briskly away from her
until another curve in the zigzag road hid
him from her sight.</p>

<p>“Some stranger’s child!” she muttered to
herself, going back to the doorstep. “I
have never seen him pass here before, and
few there be who pass by without the
knowledge of Chiara. Well, I am glad he
has his <i>soldi</i> safe in his pocket. May the
saints protect and feed my own children
when they go a-wandering! You, Beppo!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>keep your head out of the dust of the
road!”</p>

<p>“Mamá, mamá, Beppino is making <i>capitomboli</i>,
such as the boy who was here just now
made in the circus at Cutigliano, on the day
we went with our father to the big tent! Do
you not remember?” cried an admiring small
sister of Beppo. “See, our Beppo does them
even better than the other boy, mamá!”</p>

<p>The woman gave a little start of recollection,
and then dismissed the idea which
had occurred to her, as impossible&mdash;fortunately,
perhaps, for Natale.</p>

<p class="p2b">“Silly girl! The circus people went down
the road a week ago to the Bagni, do <i>you</i> not
remember? How should the boy be seven
days behind? No more <i>capitomboli</i>, I say,
Beppo <i>mio</i>, in all this dust!”</p>

<p class="p2">In a carriage, with two good horses and a
fine cracking whip behind them, one may
drive from Cutigliano down to the Baths of
Lucca in the first half of a summer’s day.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>On two tired slim little legs, one would need
much more time to accomplish the journey.
Also when one has been for six days imprisoned
within stone walls, one does not
hurry&mdash;if fairly out of danger&mdash;along
beauteous and fresh-smelling paths of freedom.</p>

<p>Every hour or so after leaving the woman
and children at the fountain, Natale stopped
for a rest along the way. Sometimes he sat
down on a heap of mending stones by the
wayside, in company with some stone-breaker
hammering away in the shade of
his sun screen, a rude lattice of chestnut
boughs propped behind the heap of stones.</p>

<p>The monotonous clink of the hammer
breaking the sharp-edged stones was usually
stayed as the lonely worker turned to chat
with the large-eyed child hovering near.
Only once or twice was Natale’s cheerful
“<i>Buon’ giorno!</i>”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> returned by an unwelcoming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
growl or by sour silence. In such cases,
the dawdling feet made all haste to pass and
seek a resting-place in the shade of some
breeze-rustled chestnut tree quite out of
sight of the cross stone-breaker.</p>

<p>The second night was passed as the first
had been, out of doors, after a supper of hot
rice paid for at an <i>osteria</i>,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> a short way
back along the road. Natale might have
slept, as well, at the little inn, but he was
too unused to roofs to dream of proposing
it, and the absent-minded old landlord had
not seemed to be thinking of anything but
puffing away at his pipe, as Natale slipped
past him and out of the dingy passage-way,
after paying for his food.</p>

<p>A long-bodied two-wheeled cart stood
outside the inn door, its shafts’ ends resting
on the ground, its rear high in air, and
Natale, with an instinct for sleeping above
wheels, had decided to return to the cart
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>for a night’s lodging place when the world
should be dark again. But sleep overtook
him as he lay waiting at the foot
of a tree to which he had scrambled from
the road below, and when he roused,
dawn was staining the pale sky with
rose color.</p>

<p>The next day promised to pass as the
first had done,&mdash;with slipping shyly past
occasional houses of entertainment along
the way, with lingerings to stare into the
mysterious depths of some noisy mill in
league with the tumbling river, and with
long, monotonous trampings, between times,
along the smooth road, bordered always by
the mountains and the river. As the road
neared the valley, it crossed dashing streams
hurrying to join their waters to the broader
water of the river, and so solid was the stone
masonry of the arches that one would never
have known that he was crossing a bridge
but for the sparkle and the laughter of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>foaming water as it dashed under the road
and out again.</p>

<p>Many times Natale, himself a small dark
speck on the endless white road, looked up
the long mountain slopes, green in the sunlight,
purple in the shadow, and glimpsed
high above him on the giddy heights the
climbing roofs of some hoary old mountain
town, away out of hearing of the busy
river, out of reach of traveling circus wagons,
and which,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Like an eagle’s nest hangs on the crest</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of purple Apennine.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was past noon of the second day when
Natale entered a village on a level with the
highway. Here the road suddenly changed
into a stone-paved street, running between
high houses and echoing with the tramp of
wooden-soled shoes and the patter of donkeys’
hoofs.</p>

<p>He stopped at the door of a sour-smelling
wine shop where sat a man on a stool outside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
the door. To him the little boy put
his question as to whether this town might
perhaps be very near to the Bagni di Lucca.
This man wore a red fez on his bushy, black
head, and down his long, black beard trickled
drops from the wine cup at his lips. The
fellow did not stop his drinking long enough
to reply in so many words to the question,
but a decided shaking of his head and the
pointing of a long, dirty finger onward sufficiently
enlightened Natale, and he kept
slowly on his way.</p>

<p>In passing a small baker’s shop, he
stopped and bought a great ring of sweetish
bread, and then slipping his arm through
this, he went more cheerily onward. There
were still many <i>soldi</i> left in his pocket, and
surely this beautiful ring of bread would last
until the Bagni di Lucca should come in
sight, with, of course, the dear yellow tent
set in its midst!</p>

<p>One of the last houses he passed as he left
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>the town was entered through a garden by
a huge wooden door opening upon the
cobblestones of the street. This door
stood ajar, and Natale stayed his steps for
a moment to gaze through the aperture
down a charming vista of trellised vines
supported on crumbling white columns of
masonry. Green and gold lights played
over the rough paving-stones of the cloister-like
colonnade through the latticework
above. Halfway down this corridor, two
or three girls romped and sang together,
their scarlet kerchiefs and the rich blues of
their skirts making dashes of vivid color in
the shade where they lounged. Pale jewels
of grapes, already growing pink and amethystine,
crowded the vines with promise of
luscious sweetness when their full time
should come.</p>

<p>The girls peered back at the travel-worn
lad peering in at them, but when the largest
of them called mockingly to him, “Enter,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>signore!” Natale ran away down the street
and again out upon the road. The girls
had made him think of Arduina and Olga
and little Maria, and away down at the end
of the corridor he had caught a glimpse of
a gray-haired woman sitting on a flight of
broken stone steps, with an infant on her
lap. His heart swelled with homesickness.
If only he might see Nonna once again!
How long was the monotonous road to
Bagni di Lucca!</p>

<p>The day, however, was not to close without
an exciting and important event.</p>

<span class="smaller">FLUTTERING A LITTLE FARTHER</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">N</span>atale</span> sat down in his leisurely
fashion on the low wall bounding
the road just beyond the town and
began daintily nibbling around the crisp,
sugared edges of his bread ring. It was
mid-afternoon, and while his jaws worked
steadily, his wide bright eyes watched with
interest two bicyclists toiling up the hill and
trundling their wheels alongside. As they
passed him by without a glance, their faces
red and perspiring, and their shoes whitened
with the light dust, the boy’s eyes still followed
them and lighted upon a queer figure
coming from the town he had just quitted.
It was the red-capped, swarthy-faced man
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>of the wine-shop door, and now his shoulders
were bent under a pack slung on his back,
and his legs were bowed as he limped along,
and he wore an old overcoat much too long,
which had seen better days upon another’s
shoulders.</p>

<p>The wheelmen paid no attention to this
fellow, as he stopped on meeting them and
perhaps offered them a sight of his wares
hidden in the pack, so the peddler presently
came up with Natale, grumbling sourly.</p>

<p>“These foreigners without manners!” he
growled, planting himself in front of the
little boy’s swinging legs. “Ah! you are
the boy who goes to the Bagni. Come, I
also go thither. We shall be companions
merry enough!”</p>

<p>Natale had no fancy for joining company
with this man who frowned with his black
brows and grinned, in turn, with big white
teeth gleaming in his hairy face, but neither
had he the courage to demur. Therefore,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>he slipped down unwillingly from his perch
and trotted along at the peddler’s side.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the man asked no questions
and spoke little, and before evening, his
steady tramp had led Natale over more
miles than the whole previous day had
carried him. Little cared this strange,
silent fellow for leaning over walls to gaze
at the foaming water singing over the rocks,
or for idly resting on a bridge to watch the
white cloud-ships crossing the azure sea
overhead, as the white sails of the orange
boats ply the blue waves between Sicily
and the Italian coast, and to dream of
future glory as an acrobat of renown!</p>

<p>The sun had again sunk behind the
rounded summits in the west, when the
peddler at last stood still and grinned down
upon the panting child.</p>

<p>“One easily sees that you are no traveler,”
he said in his hoarse, unpleasant voice.
“Now we will sit down here by the roadside
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>and make our beds for the night. Did you
mention supper? The bracelet you wear
on your arm will suffice for us both, if we
divide it according to the size of our
stomachs. <i>Ecco!</i>” And Natale’s precious
ring of sweetened bread was rudely snatched
from his arm.</p>

<p>Naturally, Natale was most indignant at
being treated in this manner by so perfect
a stranger, and he did not hesitate to remonstrate.</p>

<p>“But the bread is mine, signore! I
bought it with my own <i>soldi</i> in the town,”
he cried, clutching at the beautiful ring of
bread, already being broken in two by the
peddler’s dirty fingers.</p>

<p>“<i>Soldi!</i>” echoed the man; “and where
are your precious <i>soldi</i>?”</p>

<p>“At the shop where I bought the bread,
of course,” was the shrewd reply, and not
a coin remaining in Natale’s pocket jostled
against its neighbor now. They kept as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>quiet as if they knew that long, eager fingers
were ready to pounce upon them.</p>

<p>Then a change came over the peddler’s
manner, and he showed his unpleasant-looking
teeth in a broad smile. Perhaps
he was planning a look into those little
pockets by and by, who knows?</p>

<p>“What a clever boy you are!” he cried.
“Well, as you are also such a hungry little
beast, take back your bread, and for a
relish I shall give you a smell of my own
supper. See!”</p>

<p>So speaking, he drew a roll of sausage
from a pocket of his long coat. The sausage
was wrapped in a soiled handkerchief, and
there was a hunk of black bread with it.
A knife with a curious curved handle and
long, shining blade was next produced, and
the peddler went to work, alternately whacking
off bits of the highly seasoned meat
and the hard bread, and devouring them
with crunching teeth and smacking lips.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span></p>
<p>Natale gnawed industriously at his own
bread without even thinking of offering to
barter a portion of it for a taste of the savory
sausage. There was a kind of fascination
in watching the ugly fellow eat, and the
wondering brown eyes were fixed upon the
peddler’s surly face.</p>

<p>It was now the close of a warm afternoon.
A light haze wrapped the more distant
mountains in misty blue, a chirring of
insects stirred the silence about the travelers,
and now and then a carriage or cart whisked
downward, or toiled upward, along the road,
accompanied by the jingle of harness bells
and the whooping cries of the drivers. A
fog of white dust rose behind every passing
vehicle, and the chestnut leaves overhead,
long unwashed by rain, hung grimy and
listless in the heavy air.</p>

<p>As the peddler supped, large drops of
sweat gathered on his long, red nose and
dripped down his black beard, while his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>face grew flushed and more scowling than
ever. Presently, with an angry movement
which startled Natale half out of his wits,
he dropped the sausage and knife to the
ground and tore off his coat.</p>

<p>“Poor men have no choice!” he muttered.
“Bare shoulders in winter, the cast-off
winter coat of an Englishman in summer!”</p>

<p>The soiled and tattered old coat was
tossed aside, falling uncomfortably close to
Natale’s feet, but he did not dare to push it
away with disdainful touch. The peddler’s
meal now came to an end, the remains of the
sausage were gathered up with the cruel-looking
knife and laid aside with the handkerchief,
after which the peddler, with a
satisfied grunt, sprawled himself on his
side&mdash;to sleep, as Natale devoutly hoped.</p>

<p>But not quite yet was the man ready for
sleep. Reaching for his pack, with a lazy
movement from where he lay, he unstrapped
it and drew from among the coarse
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>laces and horn buttons inside a flat bottle,
which he uncorked and turned up to his
lips. As the liquor gurgled down his throat
and its strong odor tainted the air, Natale
let his eyes fall to the uncomely garment
lying within touch of his fingers.</p>

<p>Then the boy’s heart leaped into his
throat, and it seemed as if he would suffocate
where he sat. He dared not move, and
bravely he looked away from the thing
which lay within such easy reach of his longing
hands, half-in, half-out of the fellow’s
old coat pocket.</p>

<p>If only the peddling thief would go off
into a drunken sleep!</p>

<p>For there, close by, lay Giovanni’s old
pocketbook of stamped Spanish leather,
stained and battered, as Natale had always
known it!</p>

<p>Who could tell whether any money still
remained in it? There was nothing to do
but wait till the man should go to sleep, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>then, stealthily drawing the pocketbook
away from the overcoat, speed down the
road to a safe distance and find out all
about it.</p>

<p>He had not long to wait before the peddler
returned the bottle to the pack, and then,
disposing himself on the ground, sank into
an open-mouthed slumber.</p>

<p>Only when quite sure that the sleep was
real did Natale steal away on noiseless feet,
prize in hand, across the shallow ditch bordering
the road, and onward to the shelter
of a ruined shed quite out of sight of their
resting-place. Putting the shed between
him and the road, Natale unstrapped the
pocketbook with trembling eagerness.</p>

<p>There lay the notes into which Giovanni
had from time to time changed the cumbersome
copper soldi of their earnings! There
were the dingy blue five-franc notes, with
many one and two-franc notes of a most
uncompromising dirt color!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>

<p>The boy dared not take time to count
them all. The fierce ogre asleep under the
tree might rouse at any moment and find the
pocketbook gone. Away, away, he must
fly, on and on toward the Bagni di Lucca,
even though evening was at hand, and a
gray blanket of cloud threatened to hide
the coming stars. So the little feet twinkled
away through the dust, Natale’s heart now
heavy with the dread of what was behind,
now light with the joy of what might be
ahead. As the warm dusk fell, it seemed
safe to walk again, although every sound
from behind made Natale’s heart seem to
leap into his throat. Indeed, it seemed
pretty much to stay in his throat, until, by
and by, he came upon some one who was
to give him most welcome news.</p>

<p>He had traveled half a mile farther, and
still it was not yet dark when he sighted a
cluster of houses ahead and heard cheerful
human voices. Coming up to the first
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>house, he found a pretty, plump young
mother on her doorstep, cuddling a nursling
on her breast. From across the road and
about the house came busy sounds of sheep
and cows being housed for the night in their
thatched pens, and nobody seemed at
leisure except the laughing woman with the
crowing baby in her arms.</p>

<p>On plying the woman with his usual
question, Natale learned that the end of
his pilgrimage was indeed “just down the
road a little distance”, although, on such
short legs as his, the woman added thoughtfully,
it might take two hours more of brisk
walking to reach even the big circus tent,
standing on the outskirts of the Bagni all
the past week.</p>

<p>Ah! and was the circus still there?</p>

<p>Of that the woman could not speak
certainly, as some passer-by had mentioned
only the day before that but one or two
more performances were to be given before
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>the <i>circo</i> moved on to Lucca. She herself
had wished to go to see the wonderful
Antonio Bisbini, also the little Olga who
had no more fear of a great horse’s hoofs
than she herself of her baby’s brown toes.
But how was a woman to leave her house
and the tired men folks, to tramp down
the hill and up again at night, with a
heavy baby in her arms? Was the little
boy hoping to reach the tent in time for the
night’s exhibition?</p>

<p>Natale’s heart had thrilled at the mention
of Antonio’s magic name, and his spine
straightened and his head was lifted with
the pride of conscious relationship with the
hero of the circus. He gave but a thought
now to Olga’s usurpation of his place in the
ring. For was he not returning to his own
again, with the stolen pocketbook in the
breast of his blouse? What a welcome
there would be for him now!</p>

<p>“Well, good night, <i>bimbo</i>, if you will go,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>and may you enjoy seeing the riding in the
tent!” the woman called to him, looking
wistfully after the little figure plodding
away, after a polite return of her farewell.</p>

<p>Natale’s heart was carefree now, as he
limped lamely onward to the tune of the
“Dead March,” humming the air as he
went.</p>

<p>The road had been growing more level
for some hours as it entered the valley, and
the river flowed more still and deep. The
hush of night gathered under the trees, and
the birds and insects went to rest or noiselessly
crept from their haunts about vine
and root, intent upon the business of the
hour.</p>

<p>As signs of the famous Baths of Lucca
began to appear at certain curves in the
road, Natale became possessed of but
one idea. Down the river he began to see
the lights of the town, and he even thought
he heard the notes of band music, which,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>in truth, were wafted to his ears from the
terrace of the Casino. His head was full
of plans of stealing into the tent, and for at
least this last night at Bagni di Lucca, playing
his own part in the dying-horse act.
He would not take precious moments now
for practicing a somersault or wheel, as he
went along, but it was easy to rehearse the
dialogue over the dying brute&mdash;if only his
tired, tired legs could keep the road, and his
aching eyes find the old yellow tent set up
somewhere among the trees.</p>

<p>Presently, the gleaming eyes of bicycles
began to whiz by, and a squarely built,
many-windowed villa or two rose flush with
the road. A little farther now, and the tent
would surely appear, with perhaps Cara in
her red dress at the doorway, and the band
playing outside in the light of the big lamp!</p>

<p>Laughing stragglers now sauntered here
and there, none noticing the child making
his dizzy way among them toward a flare
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>of light on one side where the trees fell
apart. One would have hardly believed it
possible that there was room for even the
tent of the Circo Equestre of Antonio
Bisbini and Giovanni Marzuchetti in the
space between the long storehouse of corn
and the terraced hillside behind. Yet, not
only was the tent there, spread to its full
circle and height, but the brown wagon also
was visible, drawn within its shadow, and
now the staring brown eyes of the little
wanderer had found them both.</p>

<p>Yes, there was the dear old tent, with its
white patches upon the dull yellow, showing
against the vine-clad hillsides of the Bagni.
Also, there was the smoky lamp fastened to
a post, where two ways met and parted.
There was the usual crowd gathered outside
about the entrance where Cara in her
red dress and gauzy veil watched over the
money bowl, in wait for some possible late-arriving
spectator. The big reflecting lantern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
on the table showed the wistful features
of the outsiders as they crowded about the
tent.</p>

<p>As Natale crept around the tent, he saw
the bare, brown legs of some trespassing
youngster following squirming head and
shoulders inside, under the curtain by way
of the ground. In former times, the little
acrobat would have been the first to raise
an alarm and assist with alacrity in the
ignominious expulsion of the intruder who
wanted to see the show, and yet keep his
<i>soldi</i> in his pocket, if such were there. But
the sight of the enterprising offender made
little impression on Natale’s mind now, as
he stepped past the struggling legs, for, the
hour being much later than he thought, the
band inside just then struck up the familiar
schottisch, and Natale knew that Il Duca
was even now treading the ring in a dignified
dance, led by Giovanni himself. His heart
gave a suffocating throb, and his cheeks
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>burned. Then he shivered with cold, and
his weary legs faltered before the daring
deed about to be perpetrated.</p>

<p>There was plenty of time, even yet, and
he would do it even if Giovanni should strike
him to the ground with his cracking whip,
which had never yet, however, been raised
against him with more than threatening
intent.</p>

<p>He stopped to listen a moment longer
to the music before entering. Yes, there it
was, the schottisch, accompanied by the
beat of the clever hoofs. Then, as he
knew the moment was at hand for Il Duca
to drop dying in the ring, Natale crept
swiftly in among the players gathered as
usual in the small tent behind. Olga was
there and Arduina, in their fanciful costumes,
and Elvira, his mother, waiting for
their “cues.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="smaller">AT LAST</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> small, pale apparition of Natale,
suddenly projected into their midst,
so startled them all that even Olga
forgot to listen for the thud of Il Duca’s
heavy body on the ground and the sound of
his groans. They stared open-mouthed for
an instant, and then the apparition vanished
as suddenly as it had appeared.</p>

<p>But the strains of the “Dead March”
now recalled little Olga to herself, and she
darted from behind the curtain and out into
the light of the oil lamp, only to hear a
familiar boyish voice instead of her own
answering shrilly Giovanni’s question,
“What are you crying about, child?”</p>

<p>“Because our horse is dead!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span></p>

<p>“But are you sure he is quite dead?”
And Giovanni’s voice faltered with sudden
fear, as he gazed at Natale’s small, dusty
figure kneeling at the horse’s head, with
Oh! such a world of pleading in his dark
eyes and folded hands.</p>

<p>“Quite dead!” wailed Natale.</p>

<p>“Get up and feel his pulse, boy. If
there is any pulse he is <i>not</i> dead!” Giovanni
spoke fiercely, but there was no frown upon
his face.</p>

<p>And so the farce went on as usual, to the
end, while Olga, with pouting lips, slipped
behind the curtain again and joined the
others who were, every one, peeping in to
see little Natale do his beloved dying-horse
act.</p>

<p>The little girl had come to enjoy her bit
of acting with Giovanni and Il Duca, for
kneeling with folded hands and sobbing
breath was a pretty attitude, always loudly
applauded, and she no longer feared that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>Il Duca would lift his faithful hoof against
her. But now, here was Natale back again,
and his shrill little voice going over the silly
replies to the clown in his own, old way.
Well, it would be rather nice, after all, to
have Natale again, and she would not fuss
about it as there were so few things he could
really do, while she was learning new feats
already, and would soon be riding Tesoro
bareback around the ring.</p>

<p>A perfect storm of applause succeeded the
end of the dialogue, when Il Duca scrambled
to his feet, and the tent was filled with cries
for a repetition of the scene. But Giovanni
turned swiftly and lifted Natale to
the horse’s back, only in time to prevent the
child’s falling to the ground, as if stunned
by the noise of the shouting. Out of the
ring and through the smaller tent to the
open air beyond Il Duca pranced proudly,
with Giovanni at his bridle, holding Natale
in his place with his free hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>

<p>Outside, they laid the child down on the
warm ground in the dim light, and Arduina
brought a cupful of water and bathed his
face, while Olga stood by, and Antonio and
Elvira went back to help Giovanni with his
table-leaping inside.</p>

<p>“He is not dead, is he, Arduina?” Olga
asked in a frightened voice. “Feel his pulse
as we do Il Duca’s!”</p>

<p>“Hurry and call Nonna!” the older girl
urged nervously. “We shall have to go in,
the very next thing after this, and Nonna
will know what to do.”</p>

<p>So when Natale next opened his eyes, the
light of a sputtering candle showed him the
gray head of dear Nonna bent over him.
He lay on a small mattress in a corner, and
the smoke-stained ceiling of the house-wagon
shut out the sky.</p>

<p>“<i>Ecco!</i> he opens his eyes, my <i>bimbo</i>! my
Natalino! <i>Carino</i>,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> what does it all mean?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>Tell Nonna how you have come back to the
<i>circo</i>!”</p>
<p>But at first Natale only lifted one hand
to stroke the dear, wrinkled face of Nonna,
in smiling content. After a little, he laid
his hand on the breast of his blouse and
begged to be allowed to go to Giovanni.</p>

<p>“He will not scold me for coming back
when he sees what I have brought with
me,” he urged.</p>

<p>But Nonna reminded him that the tent
was still crowded with spectators,&mdash;did
he not hear the music close by, and the
laughter of the people, as the clown and
Antonio and Arduina did the funny pantomime?</p>

<p>Natale lay back listening, with a happy
smile on his lips, while Nonna went to blow
up the coals of a small fire on the ground
outside, and to hurry the broth that Natale
might have nourishment. She could not
prevail upon the boy to confide to her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>what he was so anxious to tell his stepfather,
and she left him alone, too glad to
have him returned to them, to grumble over
his reticence.</p>

<p>Of all the children, Natale most sweetly
recalled her own son’s childhood, and
Antonio’s boyish affection for her, his
cheeriness and obedience, had seemed to
live again in Natale, although he was
Elvira’s son, and no grandson, at all, of her
own.</p>

<p>The little ones, Tito, Maria, Gigi and the
rest, were asleep in their corners, and Nonna
had been sitting at rest in the wagon door
when Olga had rushed up with the news that
Natale had arrived and lay dying, perhaps,
on the ground outside the tent. It was
Nonna’s strong arms that had borne him
away to the house-wagon, and Nonna’s
vigorous rubbings and applications of cold
water that had brought him out of the
half-swoon of exhaustion. So Nonna was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>content with her work, and would not press
Natalino’s secret from him.</p>

<p>By the time the performance was over,
and the merry-makers had streamed out
whistling, chatting and laughing together,
and had gone their ways homeward, Natale,
fed and rested, was sitting up bright-eyed
and eager to announce his news.</p>

<p>It was stuffy and hot in the wagon, and
Giovanni went to fetch the boy outside, the
moment the tent had emptied and the
players were at leisure. Olga had not even
taken time to change the yellow satin
blouse and pink tights for her usual faded
cotton frock. As for Antonio, he had only
slipped his feet into a pair of loose slippers,
so the great acrobat stood before Natale in
all the glory of his spangled black velvet
and shapely, pink-clad limbs.</p>

<p>As the night was dark, one of the lamps
was brought from the tent, and a wild,
gypsy-like scene its rays revealed under the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>trees about the steps of the house-wagon.
Elvira, in an access of motherly tenderness,
gathered Natale to her red satin
bosom, and called him by all the musical
pet names belonging to the boys and girls
of Italy, while the musicians peeped over
the shoulders of the actors and wondered
how little Natale had ever found his way on
foot all the way from Cutigliano to the
Bagni.</p>

<p>“The tramping will have limbered up his
legs!” one whispered to another.</p>

<p>“Stiffened them, rather!” was the reply,
and then everybody stopped talking and
only gazed the harder as Natale put his
hand within the breast of his blouse and
drew out the old leather pocketbook.</p>

<p>“There, Giovanni!” he said simply,
reaching the book toward his stepfather.
“The ugly, black peddler with the red cap
like our Leo’s stole the money, and while he
slept on his back, by the road, I stole it from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>him, and then&mdash;Oh, how fast I ran and
ran that he might not catch me and kill me
with his long, sharp knife!”</p>

<p>Giovanni, speechless with astonishment
and joy, solemnly received and kissed and
opened the pocketbook, and then spread
out the notes, one by one, on his knee, while
the rest crowded around, counting them
aloud.</p>

<p>What if all should not be there? Natale’s
eyes shone feverishly as he leaned forward
from his mother’s knee, his gaze alternately
upon the clown’s face, and the long, lithe
fingers handling the money.</p>

<p>Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five,
thirty, thirty-five, forty, forty-five, fifty,
fifty-five, sixty, sixty-five, seventy, seventy-five,
eighty, eighty-two, eighty-four, eighty-six,
eighty-eight, ninety, ninety-one, ninety-two,
ninety-three, ninety-four, ninety-five,
ninety-six, ninety-seven, ninety-eight,
ninety-nine, <i>one hundred</i>!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span></p>

<p>Natale’s head dropped back against the
red satin shoulder of his mother, and his
large eyes gazed wistfully into Giovanni’s
face.</p>

<p>Would they let him stay now that he had
come all the weary way “after the wagon”,
bringing them the lost money? Their welcome
had been encouraging; would they let
him remain, or must he be sent back to
Cutigliano, to the priest, to Sora Grazia,
to school, to imprisonment in a house without
wheels, and without Nonna?</p>

<p>It was Antonio Bisbini who brought up
the question finally and in a manner settled
it with his slow-spoken words. Everybody
had wondered and rejoiced over the safe
return of the pocketbook, with the money
untouched, and Natale had had to tell all
about the peddler, and the risks he had run
of rousing the fellow from sleep in making
his escape with the pocketbook.</p>

<p>“He was the man who teased me to buy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>the beautiful diamond brooch on the day of
San Lorenzo!” cried pretty Arduina, who
well remembered the peddler’s flattering
attentions to her in his hope of finding a
purchaser for his paltry glass jewelry.</p>

<p>“And the same who so frightened our
Tito outside the church,” Nonna chimed
in indignantly. “And he all the time pretended
to be so pious and anxious to see the
saints’ relics in the church! No wonder
Tito cried at the snapping of those dirty,
thievish fingers in his little face. The
saints only know how he found the money
in Giovanni’s coat-pocket hung in the
tent!”</p>

<p>“Mamá <i>mia</i>, do you remember how stiff
my legs were when I played at leaping with
the boys at school in Florence?” Antonio,
the finished acrobat, asked thoughtfully,
breaking a long straw with his fingers and
looking at nobody. His blond head reached
almost to the lowest boughs of the chestnut
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>tree under which he stood, and the lamplight
flared over his fair face and glittering
costume.</p>

<p>Natale sat up to hear the words of this
oracle, and even slipped off the satin lap of
Elvira to the ground, in order to be nearer
Antonio.</p>

<p>“I remember that you were a studious
boy,” Nonna murmured in reply, with a
note of the old bitterness in her voice.</p>

<p>“Natale has done a good work in returning
the money to us, Giovanni,” the acrobat
continued. “Why send him back to the
foreigners? He was unhappy, or he would
never have come all this distance alone&mdash;mere
baby that he is.”</p>

<p>“And the Englishwoman’s money?”
Giovanni asked in a businesslike tone.</p>

<p>“What has been used, replace from the
pocketbook. It is not much, as we have
taken in so good a sum, here at the Bagni.
Leo can ride back with it to Cutigliano
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>to-morrow morning, and return in time for
our last night here.”</p>

<p>“<i>Ebbene!</i>” said Giovanni, and this meaning
“All right, with a very good will,” so it
was decided, and then everybody hurried
to get into comfortable old clothes and to
eat supper.</p>

<p>Leo was sent to the nearest wine shop for
a bottle of good red wine that the troop
might drink to the joy of Natale’s return
and the recovery of the money; also to the
just discomfiture of all thieving peddlers.</p>

<p>Long before the evening came to an end,
a tired but most happy little boy had crept
into the shadow and fallen asleep, with his
head pillowed against Nonna’s knee.</p>

<p>“I am glad thou art come back to us,
Natalino,” she whispered in the softest
Italian above the tangled brown curls,
while the rest sang and made merry, “and
if thy little legs will only grow as straight
and as strong as my Antonio’s, and thy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>heart remain as faithful to old Nonna, the
saints forgive me if I care very much whether
thou be acrobat or priest!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For some reason known best to himself,
but readily guessed by the clown and the
rest of the older members of the circus, the
swarthy peddler was not seen in Bagni di
Lucca for many a day after. But Natale
did not lose his dread of encountering the
fierce eyes and the cruel knife until long
after the circus troop had taken to the road
again.</p>

<p>Nothing in the world could have induced
Mrs. Bishop, the English lady at Cutigliano,
to touch the money returned with, what
was to her, most astonishing promptness
and honesty through Leo, one of the musicians.</p>

<p>In the first place, the notes were very dirty,
much more so, she was sure, than when she
had paid them to the clown a little more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>than a week before. Secondly, she would
not reclaim money which had been once
devoted to the cause of civilization and
of education. If the “little ingrate” despised
his opportunities and had finally
returned to his “wallowing in the mire”,
let the money which would have bought
him for decency and for usefulness go with
him. Thirdly&mdash;but this was not acknowledged
even to Betty&mdash;the old lady’s heart
had been touched by the tale Luigi the
priest had come to tell her on the morning
after the flight of the birdling. So her
heart was not quite so hard as her words
sounded, and she was in truth rather rejoiced,
as well as very much relieved in
mind, when Leo had arrived to tell of runaway
Natale’s return to the troop in
safety. Therefore, generously, Mrs. Bishop
would not receive the money because it
seemed to her no longer her own; surely
Giovanni and Elvira and Nonna had kept
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>their part of the bargain in giving up the
child, while Natale had not even been
consulted in their plan.</p>

<p>The roll of notes was therefore returned
by Leo to Giovanni, with the foreign lady’s
instructions that the money was to be spent
in providing meat for broth for the children
so long as it should last. There would still
be plenty of cold water always, free as air,
for daily baths along the roads of Italy, and
Mrs. Bishop hoped that Sora Grazia’s
ministrations in that line would not soon
be forgotten by Natale, who for one short
week had been a scrubbed little lad. (It is
safe to say that they were not!)</p>

<p>Along with the money, Mrs. Bishop sent
a school primer to Natale, with the admonition
that he would at least try to learn
to read while jogging up and down the
earth and upsetting his stomach in all
heathenish sports.</p>

<p>But Madame Cioche and Betty rejoiced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>in open triumph over Natale’s freedom, to
say nothing of the priest Luigi and the
wise old gentleman who had in fact unwittingly
opened the cage door for flight.</p>

<p>Sora Grazia was a trifle glum for a day or
two at finding her pains thrown away upon
the sulky little protégé of the foreign lady,
but as the month’s pay for his board and
lodging had been in advance, and the
nearly new clothes and shoes and cap were
now thrown into the bargain by Mrs.
Bishop, to repay her for her extra trouble,
she too soon became content and even
pleased with the ending of the rich lady’s
scheme.</p>

<p>So the bare front wall of the priest’s
house in Cutigliano among the mountains
has, as yet, no prospect of being adorned
by a memorial tablet to a waif of all outdoors
who was willing to be a great man in
books and goodness.</p>

<p>And Natale?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span></p>

<p>Well, Natale is learning, better and better,
how to turn his <i>capitomboli</i> over the dusty
circus carpet, and he still feels Il Duca’s
pulse with sorrowful apprehension to the
tune of the “Dead March in Saul”&mdash;by
night among the oil lamps.</p>

<p>By day, he trudges along hot white roads,
under the marvelous blue of Italy’s sky,
with Niero and Bianco for company. Or,
he lies on the ground at Nonna’s side under
some spreading tree in the camping-out
times, sometimes spelling out words in a
dog-eared primer, oftener gazing past the
tree tops at the cloud-ships sailing overhead,
while Nonna tells of Antonio’s wonderful
childhood.</p>

<p>By and by, when Natale grows too large
to do the dying-horse act, and little Tito,
or Gigi takes his place, he will be dashing
with the horses around the ring. And then,
in the still further and sweeter by and by,
when Antonio’s agile legs will perhaps have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>begun to stiffen again, and the straight back
to bend forward a little as he walks, who
but Natale will be the shining star of the
Circo Equestre, like another bespangled,
pink-clad Antonio, with crisp brown curls
and laughing eyes, and the nimblest,
straightest legs in all Italy?</p>

<p>In all the big city of Havana there was no more patriotic
little girl than Amada Trueno, daughter of one of the city
gardeners. With all her heart she hated the Spaniards who
ruled her beloved island of Cuba. “Little Cuba Libre” they
called her when she stamped her foot and called the Spaniards
enemies and tyrants. When she went to her cousin’s house
in the country, although she played on friendly terms with
the children of a Spanish planter, still her hatred of the oppressors
slumbered. How the Cubans finally revolted, and
how little Amada herself took part in that revolution, even
to the extent of bearing arms, is told in this charming story.
“Little Cuba Libre” contains faithful pictures of Cuban life
and Cuban people, and while written especially for young
readers, its fine qualities should also appeal to older ones.
Besides being an interesting story of Cuban girlhood it is a
depiction of the very spirit of patriotism.</p>

<p>Mollie, Waddy and Tony are three of the most wonderful
elephants in the world. Born in India, they have traveled
all over Europe and our own America, showing their clever
tricks to thousands of boys and girls. They were bought by
the children of Boston and are now kept in the Franklin
Park Zoo, where they will remain the rest of their lives.</p>

<p>Mr. Waitt writes of their adventures when they were
traveling, and tells of some tricks they played which their
keeper never taught them. Little Tony is the roguish one,
and he is always getting into mischief. That clever little
trunk of his pokes into all sorts of places where it doesn’t belong,
and sometimes it takes Mollie, Waddy and Johann, the
keeper, to make him behave as a proper little elephant should.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This is the most bewitching elephant story we ever read.
It is the story of their travels through many countries. It is
as good a story for boys and girls as any boys and girls will
ever want to read.”&mdash;<i>Journal of Education</i>, Boston.</p>

<p>“The story of ‘The Adventure of Mollie, Waddy, and
Tony’ is one of the nicest that little people who like animals
can read.”&mdash;<i>New York Times.</i></p></div>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
